=head1 NAME

Lintian::Info::Java - access to collected java-info data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;
    my $processable = Lintian::Processable::Binary->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Info::Java provides an interface to package data for java files.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item java_info

Returns a hashref containing information about JAR files found in
source packages, in the form I<file name> -> I<info>, where I<info> is
a hash containing the following keys:

=over 4

=item manifest

A hash containing the contents of the JAR file manifest. For instance,
to find the classpath of I<$file>, you could use:

 if (exists $info->java_info->{$file}{'manifest'}) {
     my $cp = $info->java_info->{$file}{'manifest'}{'Class-Path'};
     # ...
 }

NB: Not all jar files have a manifest.  For those without, this will
value will not be available.  Use exists (rather than defined) to
check for it.

=item files

A table of the files in the JAR.  Each key is a file name and its value
is its "Major class version" for Java or "-" if it is not a class file.

=item error

If it exists, this is an error that occurred during reading of the zip
file.  If it exists, it is unlikely that the other fields will be
present.
