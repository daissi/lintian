Tag: pkg-config-references-unknown-shared-library
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The specified <tt>pkg-config(1)</tt> file references a shared
 object via, for example, <tt>Libs: -lfoo</tt> but this package
 appears to not ship the associated "libfoo.so" shared library.
 .
 This will result in a linker error and was likely caused by a missing
 installation step.
 . 
 Please ensure that your package ships the corresponding libfoo.so
 shared object file.
