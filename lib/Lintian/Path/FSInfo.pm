=head1 NAME

Lintian::Path::FSInfo - File System information for L<Lintian::Path>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $l_path;  # A L::Path object
  my $fs_info; # A L::Path::FSInfo object
  if ($fs_info->has_anchored_root_dir) {
    # The "root" dir is anchored and paths starting with "/" can
    # trivially be resolved (as relative to the "root" dir).
  } else {
    # The "root" dir is undefined and paths starting with "/" *cannot*
    # be resolved.
  }

=head1 CLASS METHODS

Internal constructor (used by Lintian::Processable::Package)

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item _underlying_fs_path(PATH)

Given PATH, a L<Lintian::Path>, obtain the underlying file system path
that it represents.

=cut

sub _underlying_fs_path {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;

    unless (defined $self->{'_root_fs_path'}) {

        my $collect_sub = $self->{'_collect_path_sub'};
        confess $self->name . ' does not have an underlying FS object'
          unless defined $collect_sub;

        $self->{'_root_fs_path'} = $collect_sub->();
    }

    return join('/', $self->{'_root_fs_path'}, $path->name)
      if length $path->name;

    return $self->{'_root_fs_path'};
}

=item _file_info(PATH)

Given PATH, a L<Lintian::Path>, obtain the output from file(1) about
the file, if it has been collected.  Throws an error if it not
available.

=cut

sub _file_info {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;

    my $collect_sub = $self->{'_collect_file_info_sub'};
    confess $path->name . ' has not had collected file(1) info'
      unless defined $collect_sub;

    return $collect_sub->($path->name);
}

=item has_anchored_root_dir

Returns a truth value if the "root" directory is anchored and is
defined by the path string "/".  In such cases, paths starting with
"/" are well-defined semantically and are relative to the root
directory rather than the "current" directory.

On the other hand, if this returns a non-truth value, the "root"
directory is I<not> well-defined and no path starting with "/" can be
resolved logically.

=cut

Lintian::Path::FSInfo->mk_ro_accessors(qw(has_anchored_root_dir));
