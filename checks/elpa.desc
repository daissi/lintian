Abbrev: elpa
Type: binary
Needs-Info: unpacked
Info: This script checks if the packages comply with various aspects of the
 emacsen team's policy.

Tag: emacsen-common-without-dh-elpa
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package uses the emacsen-common infrastructure but the
 package was not built with dh-elpa. Please consider transitioning
 the package build to use dh-elpa, unless the package is required to
 work with XEmacs.
 .
 dh-elpa centralises the emacsen-common maintscripts, which makes for
 fewer bugs, and significantly easier cross-archive updates to emacsen
 packages.
 .
 In addition, a package built with dh-elpa integrates with the GNU
 Emacs package manager, for a better user experience.
