Info: The Debian diff or native package contains files in a directory
 used by a bug tracking system, which are not useful in a diff or native
 package. <tt>dpkg-source</tt> will automatically exclude these if it
 is passed <tt>-I</tt> or <tt>-i</tt> for native and non-native packages
 respectively.
