Tag: info-document-not-compressed
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Info documents should be compressed with <tt>gzip -9n</tt>.
Ref: policy 12.2

Tag: info-document-not-compressed-with-gzip
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Info documents should be compressed with <tt>gzip -9n</tt>. This
 file ends in <tt>.gz</tt> but doesn't appear to be a gzip-compressed
 file.
Ref: policy 12.2

Tag: info-document-not-compressed-with-max-compression
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Info documents should be compressed with <tt>gzip -9n</tt>. This
 file is compressed with gzip, but without using maximum compression.
Ref: policy 12.2

Tag: info-document-has-wrong-extension
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The info document has an extension other than info*.gz.

Tag: info-document-missing-dir-section
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This info document has no INFO-DIR-SECTION line.
 <tt>install-info</tt> will be unable to determine the section into which
 this info page should be put. The best solution is to add a line like:
 .
   @dircategory Software development
 .
 to the texinfo source so that the generated info file will contain a
 section. See <tt>/usr/share/info/dir</tt> for sections to choose from.
 You will have to ensure that the build process builds new info files
 rather than using ones built by upstream.

Tag: info-document-missing-dir-entry
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This info document has no directory entry. This is text between
 START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY and END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY lines which is copied into
 the <tt>dir</tt> file in <tt>/usr/share/info</tt> by
 <tt>install-info</tt>. The best solution is to add lines like:
 .
   @dircategory Software development
   @direntry
   * foo: (foo).               Foo creator and editor
   @end direntry
 .
 to the texinfo source so that the generated info file will contain an
 appropriate entry. You will have to ensure that the build process builds
 new info files rather than using ones built by upstream.

Tag: info-document-missing-image-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This info document contains an "[image]" but the image file it
 specifies is missing. Texinfo <tt>@image{}</tt> becomes
 .
  [image src="filename.png"]
 .
 in the <tt>.info</tt>. Emacs 22 and up info
 mode can display this in a GUI if filename.png is in
 <tt>/usr/share/info</tt> or if the src gives a path to the file
 elsewhere.
 .
 If you put an image file in <tt>/usr/share/info</tt> then please name
 it like the document so as to avoid name clashes. Eg. foo.info might
 call an image foo-example1.png. If upstream does not do this already
 then it may be easier to <tt>sed</tt> the <tt>src=""</tt> to a path
 elsewhere, perhaps to share with an HTML rendition under say
 <tt>/usr/share/doc/foo/html/</tt>.
