=head1 NAME

Lintian::Processable -- An (abstract) object that Lintian can process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Lintian::Processable::Package;
 
 # Instantiate via Lintian::Processable::Package
 my $proc = Lintian::Processable::Package->new ('lintian_2.5.0_all.deb');
 my $pkg_name = $proc->pkg_name;
 my $pkg_version = $proc->pkg_version;
 # etc.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Instances of this perl class are objects that Lintian can process (e.g.
deb files).  Multiple objects can then be combined into
L<groups|Lintian::ProcessableGroup>, which Lintian will process
together.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new_from_metadata (TYPE, PARAGRAPH[, BASEPATH])

Returns a Lintian::Processable from a PARAGRAPH in a Sources or a
Packages file with the following exception.

If the PARAGRAPH has a field named "pkg_path", then that is used
instead of creating the path from BASEPATH path concatenated with the
TYPE specific field(s).  Hench BASEPATH is optional if and only if,
the paragraph has a field called "pkg_path".

The TYPE parameter determines the type of the processable and is
required.

NB: Optional fields (e.g. "Source" for binaries) may be omitted in
PARAGRAPH as usual.  In this case, the respective values are computed
from the required fields according to the Policy Manual.

sub _make_identifier {

    }
    $self->{identifier} = $id;
    return;
}

=item $proc->pkg_name

Returns the package name.

=item $proc->pkg_version

Returns the version of the package.

=item $proc->pkg_path

Returns the path to the packaged version of actual package.  This path
is used in case the data needs to be extracted from the package.

Note: This may return the path to a symlink to the package.

=item $proc->pkg_type

Returns the type of package (e.g. binary, source, udeb ...)

=item $proc->pkg_arch

Returns the architecture(s) of the package. May return multiple values
from changes processables.  For source processables it is "source".

=item $proc->pkg_src

Returns the name of the source package.

=item $proc->pkg_src_version

Returns the version of the source package.

=item $proc->tainted

Returns a truth value if one or more fields in this Processable is
tainted.  On a best effort basis tainted fields will be sanitized
to less dangerous (but possibly invalid) values.

=item $proc->identifier

Produces an identifier for this processable.  The identifier is
based on the type, name, version and architecture of the package.

=cut

Lintian::Processable->mk_ro_accessors(
    qw(pkg_name pkg_version pkg_src pkg_arch pkg_path pkg_type pkg_src_version tainted identifier)
);

=item $proc->group([$group])

Returns the L<group|Lintian::ProcessableGroup> $proc is in,
if any.  If the processable is not in a group, this returns C<undef>.

Can also be used to set the group of this processable.

=cut

Lintian::Processable->mk_accessors(qw(group));

=item $proc->info

Returns L<$info|Lintian::Collect> element for this processable.

Note: This method must be implemented by sub-classes unless they
provide an "info" field.

=cut

sub info {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->{info} if exists $self->{info};
    croak 'Not implemented.';
}

=item $proc->clear_cache

Discard the info element, so the memory used by it can be reclaimed.
Mostly useful when checking a lot of packages (e.g. on lintian.d.o).

Note: By default this does nothing, but it may (and should) be
overridden by sub-classes.

=cut

sub clear_cache {
    return;
}

=item $proc->get_field ($field[, $def])

Optional method to access a field in the underlying data set.

Returns $def if the field is not present or the implementation does
not have (or want to expose) it.  This method is I<not> guaranteed to
return the same value as "$proc->info->field ($field, $def)".

If C<$def> is omitted is defaults to C<undef>.

Default implementation accesses them via the hashref stored in
"extra-fields" if present.  If the field is present, but not defined
$def is returned instead.

NB: This is mostly an optimization used by L<Lintian::Lab> to avoid
(re-)reading the underlying package data.

=cut

sub get_field {
    my ($self, $field, $def) = @_;
    return $def
      unless exists $self->{'extra-fields'}
      and exists $self->{'extra-fields'}{$field};
    return $self->{'extra-fields'}{$field}//$def;
}

=item get_group_id

Calculates an appropriate group id for the package. It is based
on the name and the version of the src-pkg.

=cut

sub get_group_id{
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $id = $self->pkg_src . '/' . $self->pkg_src_version;

    return $id;
}
