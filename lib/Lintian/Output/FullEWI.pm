package Lintian::Output::FullEWI;

# The FullEWI always emit *full* package metadata even if it is
# redundant (that is, optional values are always included) when
# emitting tags.
#   Other than that, it is identical to the normal output.
#
# When parsing a lintian.log written in format, it is no longer
# ambiguous which package is referred to (even if --verbose is
# not used).
#
# The full format of the emitted tag is:
#
#  C: name type (version) [arch]: tag [...]
#
# Note the "[...]" is the extra which may or may not be present
# depending on the tag.
#
# Notable cases:
# * binary packages include type classification
# * source packages include an architecture, which is always
#   "source".
# * "[arch]" may contain spaces (and generally do for .changes)
#   files.
# * "(version)" may contain colon (i.e. epoch versions)
