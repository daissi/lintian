Check-Script: deb-format
Author: Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>
Abbrev: dfmt
Type: binary, udeb
Needs-Info: unpacked, bin-pkg-control
Info: This script checks the format of the deb ar archive itself.

Tag: malformed-deb-archive
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The binary package is not a correctly constructed archive. A binary
 Debian package must be an ar archive with exactly three members:
 <tt>debian-binary</tt>, <tt>control.tar.gz</tt>, and one of
 <tt>data.tar.gz</tt>, <tt>data.tar.bz2</tt> or <tt>data.tar.xz</tt>
 in exactly that order. The <tt>debian-binary</tt> member must start
 with a single line containing the version number, with a major revision
 of 2.

Tag: misplaced-extra-member-in-deb
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The binary package contains an extra member that Lintian did not
 expect or expected at a different position.
Ref: deb(5)

Tag: lzma-deb-archive
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The data portion of this binary package is compressed with lzma.
 This is supported by dpkg but not yet permitted in the Debian archive.
 Such a package will be rejected by DAK.

Tag: tar-errors-from-control
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: tar produced an error while listing the contents of the
 <tt>control.tar.gz</tt> member of this package. This probably means
 there's something broken or at least strange about the way the package
 was constructed.

Tag: tar-errors-from-data
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: tar produced an error while listing the contents of the data
 member of this package. This probably means there's something broken or
 at least strange about the way the package was constructed.

Tag: udeb-uses-unsupported-compression-for-data-tarball
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The data tarball of this udeb package is not compressed in format
 that udpkg (debian-installer's dpkg equivalent) does not support. Thus
 the udeb is likely to be uninstallable and could break daily or weekly
 d-i images.
 .
 Currently, udpkg supports .gz and .xz compressed tarballs.

Tag: uses-deprecated-compression-for-data-tarball
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The data portion of this binary package uses a deprecated compression
 format. Although dpkg will support extracting such binary packages for
 the foreseeable future, creating them will eventually be disallowed. A
 warning is emitted for lzma since dpkg 1.16.4, and for bzip2 since dpkg
 1.17.7.
 .
 For lzma, xz is the direct replacement. For bzip2 either gzip or xz can
 be used as a substitute, depending on the wanted properties: gzip for
 maximum compatibility and speed, and xz for maximum compression ratio.

Tag: uses-no-compression-for-control-tarball
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: deb(5)
Info: The control portion of this binary package uses a non-compressed
 format. Although dpkg will support extracting such binary packages
 since dpkg 1.10.24, creating them is not advised except in special
 cases.

 Except if data is non-compressible, use gzip for
 maximum compatibility and speed, and xz for maximum compression ratio.

Tag: data-tarball-compression-format
Severity: classification
Certainty: certain
Info: This is the compressor format used for the <tt>data.tar</tt> tarball.

Tag: control-tarball-compression-format
Severity: classification
Certainty: certain
Info: This is the compressor format used for the <tt>control.tar</tt> tarball.
