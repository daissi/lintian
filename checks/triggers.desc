Check-Script: triggers
Author: Niels Thykier <niels@thykier.net>
Type: binary, udeb
Info: Check of trigger files in the binary package.
Needs-Info: bin-pkg-control

Tag: unknown-trigger
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The package has a trigger that Lintian does not recognise in its
 control file.
 .
 The package may be uninstallable if dpkg does not support the trigger.
 .
 If this is a new type of trigger, then Lintian may simply be out of date.
 Please verify if the latest version of Lintian knows of the trigger, or file
 a bug against Lintian.

Tag: uses-implicit-await-trigger
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The listed trigger is present in the control file of the package.
 The trigger is an await trigger, which may not be obvious from its name.
 .
 Await triggers place rather strong requirements on dpkg that often lead
 to trigger cycles due to changes in other packages.
 .
 If the package does not need the guarantees that dpkg provides to await
 triggers, please use the "-noawait" variant of the trigger. This is often
 the case for packages that use the trigger to compile a form of cache.
 .
 If the package does need the guarantees provided by dpkg, then please
 document the rationale in a comment above the trigger and use the
 "-await" variant of the trigger to avoid this warning.

Tag: repeated-trigger-name
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package repeats the same trigger. There should be no reason to
 do this and it may lead to confusing results or errors.
 .
 For the same "base" type of trigger (e.g. two <tt>interest</tt>-type triggers)
 the last declaration will be the effective one.
 .
 This tag is also triggered if the package has an <tt>activate</tt> trigger
 for something on which it also declares an <tt>interest</tt>. The only (but
 rather unlikely) reason to do this is if another package <i>also</i>
 declares an <tt>interest</tt> and this package needs to activate that
 other package. If the package is using it for this exact purpose, then
 please use a Lintian override to state this.
 .
 Please remove any duplicate definitions.
