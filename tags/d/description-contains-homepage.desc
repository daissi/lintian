Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Check: description
Info: The extended description contains a "Homepage" pseudo-field
 following the old Developer's Reference recommendation. As of 1.14.6,
 dpkg now supports Homepage as a regular field in
 <tt>debian/control</tt>. This pseudo-field should be moved from the
 extended description to the fields for the relevant source or binary
 packages.
