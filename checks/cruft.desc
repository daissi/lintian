Tag: debian-files-list-in-source
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Leaving <tt>debian/files</tt> causes problems for the autobuilders,
 since that file will likely include the list of .deb files for another
 architecture, which will cause dpkg-buildpackage run by the buildd to fail.
 .
 The clean rule for the package should remove this file.

Tag: diff-contains-cmake-cache-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The Debian diff contains a CMake cache file.  These files embed the
 full path of the source tree in which they're created and cause build
 failures if they exist when the source is built under a different path,
 so they will always cause errors on the buildds.  The file was probably
 accidentally included.  If it is present in the upstream source, don't
 modify it in the Debian diff; instead, delete it before the build in
 <tt>debian/rules</tt>.

Tag: diff-contains-cvs-control-dir
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains files in a CVS directory.
 These are usually artifacts of the revision control system used by the
 Debian maintainer and not useful in a diff or native package.
 <tt>dpkg-source</tt> will automatically exclude these if it is passed
 <tt>-I</tt> or <tt>-i</tt> for native and non-native packages respectively.

Tag: source-contains-cvs-control-dir
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source contains a CVS directory.  It was most likely
 included by accident since CVS directories usually don't belong in
 releases.  When packaging a CVS snapshot, export from CVS rather than use
 a checkout.  If an upstream release tarball contains CVS directories, you
 usually should report this as a bug to upstream.

Tag: diff-contains-svn-control-dir
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains files in an .svn
 directory.  These are usually artifacts of the revision control system
 used by the Debian maintainer and not useful in a diff or native package.
 <tt>dpkg-source</tt> will automatically exclude these if it is passed
 <tt>-I</tt> or <tt>-i</tt> for native and non-native packages respectively.

Tag: source-contains-svn-control-dir
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source contains an .svn directory.  It was most likely
 included by accident since Subversion version control directories
 usually don't belong in releases.  When packaging a Subversion snapshot,
 export from Subversion rather than checkout.  If an upstream release
 tarball contains .svn directories, this should be reported as a bug to
 upstream since it can double the size of the tarball to no purpose.

Tag: diff-contains-bzr-control-dir
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains files in a .bzr
 directory.  These are usually artifacts of the revision control system
 used by the Debian maintainer and not useful in a diff or native package.
 <tt>dpkg-source</tt> will automatically exclude these if it is passed
 <tt>-I</tt> or <tt>-i</tt> for native and non-native packages respectively.
Ref: dpkg-source(1)

Tag: source-contains-bzr-control-dir
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source contains a .bzr directory. It was most likely
 included by accident since bazaar-ng version control directories usually
 don't belong in releases and may contain the entire repository.  When
 packaging a bzr snapshot, use bzr export to create a clean tree.  If an
 upstream release tarball contains .bzr directories, you should usually
 report this as a bug upstream.

Tag: diff-contains-arch-control-dir
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains files in an {arch} or
 .arch-ids directory or a directory starting with <tt>,,</tt> (used by baz
 for debugging traces).  These are usually artifacts of the revision
 control system used by the Debian maintainer and not useful in a diff or
 native package.  <tt>dpkg-source</tt> will automatically exclude these if
 it is passed <tt>-I</tt> or <tt>-i</tt> for native and non-native

Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source contains an {arch} or .arch-ids directory or a
 directory starting with <tt>,,</tt> (used by baz for debugging traces).
 It was most likely included by accident since Arch version control
 directories usually don't belong in releases.  If an upstream release
 tarball contains these directories, you should usually report this as a
 bug upstream.

Tag: source-contains-git-control-dir
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source contains a .git directory. It was most likely
 included by accident since git version control directories usually don't
 belong in releases and may contain a complete copy of the repository.  If
 an upstream release tarball contains .git directories, you should usually
 report this as a bug upstream.

Tag: diff-contains-hg-control-dir
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains files in a .hg

 directories usually don't belong in releases.

Tag: diff-contains-svn-commit-file
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains an
 <tt>svn-commit(.NNN).tmp</tt>, almost certainly a left-over from a failed
 Subversion commit by the Debian package maintainer.

Tag: source-contains-svn-commit-file
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source contains an <tt>svn-commit(.NNN).tmp</tt>,

 is Arch metadata that should normally not be distributed.  You may want
 to report this as an upstream bug.

Tag: diff-contains-hg-tags-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains an <tt>.hgtags</tt>
 file.  This file is Mercurial metadata that should normally not be
 distributed.  It stores hashes of tagged commits in a Mercurial
 repository and isn't therefore useful without the repository.

Tag: diff-contains-cvs-conflict-copy
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains a CVS conflict copy.
 These have file names like <tt>.#file.version</tt> and are generated by
 CVS when a conflict was detected when merging local changes with updates
 from a source repository.  They're useful only while resolving the
 conflict and should not be included in the package.

Tag: source-contains-cvs-conflict-copy
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source contains a CVS conflict copy.  These have file
 names like <tt>.#file.version</tt> and are generated by CVS when a
 conflict was detected when merging local changes with updates from a
 source repository.  They're useful only while resolving the conflict and
 were probably included by accident.  You may want to report this as an
 upstream bug.

Tag: diff-contains-svn-conflict-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains a file that looks like a
 Subversion conflict file.  These are generated by Subversion when a
 conflict was detected while merging local changes with updates from a
 source repository.  Use <tt>svn resolved</tt> to remove them and clear
 the Subversion conflict state after you have resolved the conflict.

Tag: source-contains-svn-conflict-file

 conflict file.  These are generated by Subversion when a conflict was
 detected while merging local changes with updates from a source
 repository.  They're useful only while resolving the conflict and
 were probably included by accident.  You may want to report this as an

Tag: diff-contains-patch-failure-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains a file that looks like
 the files left behind by the <tt>patch</tt> utility when it cannot
 completely apply a diff.  This may be left over from a patch applied by
 the maintainer.  Normally such files should not be included in the
 package.

Tag: diff-contains-editor-backup-file
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains a file ending in
 <tt>~</tt> or of the form <tt>.xxx.swp</tt>, which is normally either an
 Emacs or vim backup file or a backup file created by programs such as
 <tt>autoheader</tt> or <tt>debconf-updatepo</tt>.  This usually causes no
 harm, but it's messy and bloats the size of the Debian diff to no useful
 purpose.

Tag: diff-contains-substvars
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Lintian found a substvars file in the Debian diff for this source
 package. The debian/substvars (or debian/<tt>package</tt>.substvars) file
 is usually generated and modified dynamically by debian/rules targets, in
 which case it must be removed by the clean target.
Ref: policy 4.9

Tag: empty-debian-diff
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The Debian diff of this non-native package appears to be completely
 empty.  This usually indicates a mistake when generating the upstream
 tarball, or it may mean that this was intended to be a native package and
 was built non-native by mistake.
 .
 If the Debian packaging is maintained in conjunction with upstream, this
 may be intentional, but it's not recommended best practice.  If the
 software is only for Debian, it should be a native package; otherwise,
 it's better to omit the <tt>debian</tt> directory from upstream releases
 and add it in the Debian diff.  Otherwise, it can cause problems for some
 package updates in Debian (files can't be removed from the
 <tt>debian</tt> directory via the diff, for example).

Tag: debian-upstream-obsolete-path
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Upstream metadata is stored under an obsolete path.
 .
 Upstream MEtadata GAthered with YAml (UMEGAYA) is an effort to collect
 meta-information about upstream projects from any source package
 with a publicly accessible VCS via a file called
 <tt>debian/upstream/metadata</tt>.
 .
 Older versions of this specification used
 <tt>debian/upstream-metadata.yaml</tt> or <tt>debian/upstream</tt>
 as meta-information storage file.
 .
 You should move any such file to <tt>debian/upstream/metadata</tt>.

Tag: configure-generated-file-in-source
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Leaving config.cache/status causes autobuilders problems.
 config.cache and config.status are produced by GNU autoconf's configure
 scripts. If they are left in the source package, autobuilders may pick
 up settings for the wrong architecture.
 .
 The clean rule in <tt>debian/rules</tt> should remove this file. This
 should ideally be done by fixing the upstream build system to do it when
 you run the appropriate cleaning command (and don't forget to forward the
 fix to the upstream authors so it doesn't happen in the next release). If
 that is already implemented, then make sure you are indeed cleaning it in
 the clean rule. If all else fails, a simple rm -f should work.
 .
 Note that Lintian cannot reliably detect the removal in the clean rule,
 so once you fix this, please ignore or override this warning.

Tag: ancient-libtool
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The referenced file seems to be from a libtool version older than
 1.5.2-2.  This might lead to build errors on some newer architectures not
 known to this libtool.
 .
 Please ask your upstream maintainer to re-libtoolize the package or do it
 yourself if there is no active upstream.  You will also need to run
 Autoconf to regenerate the configure script.  Usually it is best to do
 this during the build by depending on autoconf, libtool, and automake if
 it is used, and then running:
 .
  autoreconf -i --force
 .
 before running configure.  Depending on how old the package is, this may
 require additional modifications to <tt>configure.ac</tt> or
 <tt>configure.in</tt> or other work.  If you do this during the build,
 determine which files it will add or update and be sure to remove those
 files in the clean target.
 .
 If you have fixed architecture-specific issues with minimal patches,
 rather than updating libtool, and verified that it builds correctly,
 please override this tag.  Lintian will not be able to verify that.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-binary
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt ELF object.  They are usually
 left by mistake when generating the tarball by not cleaning the source
 directory first.  You may want to report this as an upstream bug, in case
 there is no sign that this was intended.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-flash-object
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt file in the Shockwave Flash (SWF)
 or Flash Video (FLV) format.  These are often included by mistake when
 developers generate a tarball without cleaning the source directory
 first.  An exception is simple video files, which are their own
 source.
 .
 If there is no sign this was intended, consider reporting it as an
 upstream bug.
 .
 If the Flash file is not meant to be modified directly, please make
 sure the package includes the source for the file and that the
 packaging rebuilds it.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-flash-project
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt file in the Shockwave Flash
 project (FLA) format.  These are often included by mistake when

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-javascript-object
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt (minified) JavaScript object.

 cleaning the source directory first.  You may want to report this as
 an upstream bug, in case there is no sign that this was intended.

Tag: embedded-script-includes-copyright-statement
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The specified file includes an embedded script with a copyright
 statement.
 .
 The script was likely copy-pasted and likely needs to be rebuilt from
 the original source.
 .
 This script may be also outdated and may need need to be updated from a
 security point of view.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-ms-help-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt Microsoft precompiled help
 file (CHM file).  These are often included by mistake when developers generate
 a tarball without cleaning the source directory first.
 .
 CHM files are mainly produced by proprietary, Windows-specific software.
 They are also mainly consumed by the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop.
 .
 Whilst there is free software to read and write them, any
 examples existing in source packages are likely to be created
 by the proprietary Microsoft software and are probably missing
 the source HTML and associated files.
 .
 If there is no sign this was intended, consider reporting it as
 an upstream bug.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-sphinx-documentation
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains prebuilt Sphinx documentation.
 This is usually left by mistake when generating the tarball without
 first cleaning the source directory.  You may want to report this as
 an upstream bug, if there is no sign that this was intended.
 .
 It is preferable to rebuild documentation directly from source.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-pandoc-documentation
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains prebuilt pandoc documentation.
 This is usually left by mistake when generating the tarball without

 in case there is no sign that this was intended.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-silverlight-object
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt Silverlight control.
 Unfortunately, the tools used to build such files have non-free
 dependencies and are not present in Debian.  This file must be
 completely removed.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-windows-binary
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt binary for Microsoft Windows.
 They are usually provided for the convenience of users.  These files
 usually just take up space in the tarball.
 .
 However, they may be a DFSG violation in that the corresponding source
 and build system are not available.
 .
 Check if upstream also provides source-only tarballs that you can use as
 the upstream distribution instead.  If not, you may want to ask upstream
 to provide source-only tarballs.

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-wasm-binary
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt binary wasm object.
 They are usually provided for the convenience of users.  These files

Tag: source-contains-waf-binary
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The source tarball contains a waf binary. This file is a Python
 script with an embedded bzip2 archive, which is uncompressed and unpacked
 at runtime.
 .
 Although corresponding sources can be easily extracted, FTP Team does not
 consider waf binary as the preferred form of modification; it should be
 provided unpacked instead, or completely removed, if possible.
 .
 You might want to follow these guidelines to obtain an unpacked waf:

Tag: tar-errors-from-source
Severity: normal
Certainty: wild-guess
Info: tar produced an error while unpacking this source package.  This
 probably means there's something broken or at least strange about the way
 the upstream tar file was constructed.  You may want to report this as an
 upstream bug.

Tag: control-file-with-CRLF-EOLs
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The given control file uses <tt>CRLF</tt> as line terminator

 If this is a false-positive, please report a bug against Lintian.

Tag: source-contains-unsafe-symlink
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The source contains an unsafe symlink.  If followed, the link
 will escape the source root.  Note that all absolute symlinks are
 unconditionally considered "unsafe" in this case (unlike in binary
 packages).
 .
 If it is a part of the package's testsuite, Lintian may have failed
 to recognise it as a test.  In that case, please override the tag.

Tag: insane-line-length-in-source-file
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The source file includes a line length that is well beyond
 the normally human made code line length.
 .
 This very long line length does not allow Lintian to do
 correctly some source file checks.
 .
 This line could also be the result of some text injected by
 a computer program, and thus could lead to FTBFS bugs.
 .
 Last but not least, long line in source code could be used
 to obfuscate the source code and to hide stuff like backdoors
 or security problems.
 .
 It could be due to jslint source comments or other build tool
 comments.
 .
 You may report this issue upstream.

Tag: source-is-missing
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The source of the following file is missing. Lintian checked a few
 possible paths to find the source, and did not find it.
 .
 Please repack your package to include the source or add it to
 "debian/missing-sources" directory.
 .
 If this is a false-positive, please report a bug against Lintian.
 .
 Please note, that insane-line-length-in-source-file tagged files
 are likely tagged source-is-missing. It is a feature not
 a bug.

Tag: source-contains-data-from-ieee-data-oui-db
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The following file contains data from the OUI database
 .
 This file contains a likely outdated copy of
 Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) database from IEEE.
 .
 Please use the files from ieee-data package instead.

Tag: source-contains-browserified-javascript
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The following file contains javascript built from browserify
 .
 This file may contain javascript that is build with the help of browserify
 or webpack tools.
 .
 You should rebuilt this file from source.

Tag: source-contains-autogenerated-visual-c++-file
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The following file is autogenerated by Microsoft Visual C++.
 .
 They are usually provided for the convenience of users.  These files
 usually just take up space in the tarball and are of no use in Debian.
 .
 Check if upstream also provides source-only tarballs that you can use as
 the upstream distribution instead.  If not, you may want to ask upstream
 to provide source-only tarballs.

Tag: source-contains-autogenerated-gperf-data
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The following file is autogenerated by gperf
 .
 They are usually provided for the convenience of users.  These files
 usually just take up space in the tarball.
 .
 Check if upstream also provides source-only tarballs that you can use as
 the upstream distribution instead.  If not, you may want to ask upstream
 to provide source-only tarballs.

# Imported from lintian4python (python/helpers)
Tag: debian-pycompat-is-obsolete
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: debian/pycompat is not used by any modern Python helper.  It should be
 safe to remove this file.

Tag: debian-pyversions-is-obsolete
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a <tt>debian/pyversions</tt> file. Since
 dh_python2 it has been recommended to use the
 <tt>X-Python3-Version</tt> field in <tt>debian/control</tt> instead.

# Imported from pkg-perl-tools (named usr-lib-perl5-mentioned there)
Tag: mentions-deprecated-usr-lib-perl5-directory
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Experimental: yes
Info: As of Perl 5.20, the vendorarch directory is /usr/lib/&lt;triplet&gt;/perl5,
 but this package still uses usr/lib/perl5 in some of the files under debian/.
 Please replace that with the value of $Config{vendorarch} configuration
 parameter, e.g.
  $(shell perl -MConfig -wE'say substr($$Config{vendorarch},1)')

Tag: readme-source-is-dh_make-template
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The debian/README.source file appears to be an unmodified or insufficiently
 modified copy of the dh_make template.
 .
 Please double-check the README.source page and replace it with information
 about this source package or simply remove the file completely.

Tag: r-data-without-readme-source
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Many modules packaged for the R Project for Statistical Computing contain
 data files with names as *.rda, *.Rda, *.rdata, *.Rdata, etc.
 .
 When such files exist, the FTP masters expect them to be explained in
 debian/README.source, which this package is missing.
 .
 Please add a README.source documenting the origins of these files.
Ref: https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/09/msg00332.html

Tag: file-contains-fixme-placeholder
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This file appears to be incomplete or insufficiently modified as it
 contains a "FIXME" placeholder text.  These can often be generated by
 package generation tools such as dh_make or npm2deb.
 .
 Please double-check the file and replace the placeholder with the required
 command or information.

Tag: file-contains-trailing-whitespace
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: This file appears to contain one or more lines with trailing
 whitespace characters.
 .
 Whilst typically harmless and merely unsightly, they can often cause
 difficult-to-spot issues where tools interpret the whitespace characters
 literally. They are thus best avoided in their entirity.
 .
 Whitespace at the end of lines may be removed with the following:
 .
  $ sed -i -e 's@[[:space:]]*$@@g' debian/control debian/changelog
 .
 If you use Emacs, you can also use "M-x wh-cl" (whitespace-cleanup).
 .
 However, if you wish to only remove trailing spaces and leave trailing tabs
 (eg. for Makefiles), you can use the following code snippet:
 .
  $ sed -i -e 's@[ ]*$@@g' debian/rules
 .
 To remove empty lines from the end of a file, you can use:
 .
  $ sed -i -e :a -e '/^\n*$/{$d;N;};/\n$/ba' debian/rules

Tag: autotools-pkg-config-macro-not-cross-compilation-safe
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package appears to use <tt>AC_PATH_PROG</tt> to discover the
 location of <tt>pkg-config(1)</tt>. This macro fails to select the correct
 version to support cross-compilation.
 .
 A better way would be to use the <tt>PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG</tt> macro from
 <tt>pkg.m4</tt> and then using the <tt>$PKG_CONFIG</tt> shell variable.
Ref: #884798

Tag: package-does-not-install-examples
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The original source tarball contains the specified examples
 directory. However, no examples are installed in any binary packages.
 .
 Please use <tt>dh_installexamples</tt> to install these to the most
 relevant package, for example by adding the directory name followed
 by a wildcard to a <tt>debian/pkgname.examples</tt> file.
 .
 Lintian looks for any directory called <tt>examples</tt> under
 <tt>/usr/share/doc</tt> in all binary packages.
Ref: dh_installexamples(1)

Tag: package-uses-deprecated-source-override-location
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: This Debian package ships Lintian source-level overrides in the
 <tt>debian/source.lintian-overrides</tt> file.
 .
 Please use <tt>debian/source/lintian-overrides</tt> instead; the
 <tt>debian/source</tt> directory is preferred to hold "source"-specific
 files.
Ref: lintian 2.4

Tag: source-contains-empty-directory
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The upstream source tree of this package contains an empty
 directory.
 .
 Having an empty directory in itself does not cause problems but empty
 directories cannot be stored in Git.
 .
 Keeping the empty directory in the source package can prevent others
 from contributing to the package when using tools like
 <tt>git-buildpackage(1)</tt>. In this workflow the empty directory
 would be lost potentially causing errors if the installed binary
 package or its tests subsequently rely upon them.
 .
 Please ask upstream to remove these directories prior to release or to
 include an empty <tt>.gitignore</tt> file where necessary.
