Check-Script: menu-format
Author: Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>
Abbrev: mnf
Needs-Info: unpacked
Type: binary
Info: This script validates the format of <b>menu</b> files.

Tag: old-format-menu-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a menu file that is in the old menu file format.
 This format is deprecated. Convert the menu file to the new menu format.
 Note that Lintian will not test this file for any other problems.

Tag: whitespace-after-continuation-character
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item is split up over 2 or more lines using '\' at the end of
 the line to join them together. However, there is some whitespace after
 the '\' character, which is not guaranteed to be handled correctly.
 The '\' should be at the end of the line.

Tag: bad-test-in-menu-item
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu file contains an item that does not start with the text
 "?package(somepackage):". All menu file lines must test for the existence
 of a package in this way.
Ref: menu 3.2

Tag: unparsable-menu-item
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: An item of the menu file cannot be parsed as a series of tag=value
 pairs. This could be because you didn't close a set of double quotes.
Ref: menu 3.2

Tag: pkg-not-in-package-test
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This menu item doesn't test to see if the package containing it is
 installed. The start of any menu item is a conditional testing whether
 the required packages are installed. Normally this conditional should
 always check at least the package containing it, since menu items should
 be included in the package that provides the application the menu refers
 to.
 .
 This error usually indicates a misspelling of the package name in the
 menu entry or a copied menu entry from another package that doesn't apply
 to this one.
Ref: menu 3.2

Tag: duplicated-tag-in-menu-item
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item contains two instances of the same tag. This is just a
 waste of space, as menu will only use one of them.
Ref: menu 3.2

Tag: menu-item-missing-required-tag
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that is missing a required tag. It's likely
 that the line will have no effect without this tag. <tt>install-menu</tt> may
 report this as an error during package installation.

Tag: menu-item-contains-unknown-tag
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that has a tag in it that is not one
 of the standard tags (needs=, section=, title=, longtitle=, command=, etc).
 While other tags can be used for specialized purposes, this is rare and
 it's more likely the tag's name is misspelled.

Tag: menu-item-uses-icon-none
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that uses icon=none. This is redundant and
 deprecated -- if there is no icon, just leave off the icon tag.

Tag: menu-item-needs-tag-has-unknown-value
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that has a needs= field with a strange value.
 This may be intentional, but it's probably a typo that will make menu
 ignore the line.

Tag: menu-item-uses-apps-games-section
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that specifies a section under "Apps/Games".
 This section has been moved to just "Games".
Ref: menu-policy 2.1

Tag: menu-item-uses-apps-section
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that specifies a section under "Apps".
 This section has been moved to "Applications".
Ref: menu-policy 2.1

Tag: menu-item-uses-windowmanagers-section
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that specifies a section under
 "WindowManagers". This section has been moved to "Window Managers".
Ref: menu-policy 2.1

Tag: menu-item-creates-new-section
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that specifies an unknown section or uses a
 section that is intended only as a menu root, not as a section that
 applications should use directly. Check the spelling of the section and
 check the section against the list in the menu policy. (The menu
 sections changed as of June of 2007.)
Ref: menu-policy 2.1

Tag: menu-item-creates-new-root-section
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has a line that specifies a new section to put a menu
 entry in, and this section appears right in the root menu. This is
 almost certainly an error. No new sections should be added to the root
 menu without discussion with the author of menu.

Tag: menu-icon-not-in-xpm-format
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Icons in the Debian menu system should be in XPM format.
 .
 While other image types (e.g. png images) appears to "just work",
 window managers are not "required to support them". Accordingly
 using non-XPM icons could break interoperability.
Ref: menu 3.7, #591812

Tag: menu-icon-uses-relative-path
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a menu file which references an icon by a relative
 path. However, icons should be referenced by an absolute path in menu files.
Ref: menu 3.2, #693477

Tag: menu-icon-missing
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This icon file couldn't be found. If the path to the icon in the
 menu file is an absolute path, make sure that icon exists at that path in
 the package. If the path is relative or a simple filename, make sure the
 icon is installed in <tt>/usr/share/pixmaps</tt>, the default location.
 .
 If the icon is provided by another package on which this package
 depends, Lintian may not be able to determine that icon pages are
 available. In this case, after confirming that all icons are
 available after this package and its dependencies are installed,
 please add a Lintian override.
Ref: menu 3.7

Tag: menu-icon-too-big
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Icons in the Debian menu system should be at most 32x32 pixels
 (icon16x16 icons should of course be at most 16x16 pixels)
Ref: menu 3.7

Tag: menu-icon-cannot-be-parsed
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The icon file could not be parsed. Perhaps this means a bad XPM file,
 or perhaps it means the Lintian parsing needs to be improved. If the
 window managers and standard tools accept the file then probably it's the
 latter; please file a bug on Lintian then.

Tag: su-wrapper-without--c
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item command or desktop file uses an su wrapper such as
 su-to-root without the -c flag. This is a syntax error.
Ref: su-to-root(1)

Tag: su-to-root-with-usr-sbin
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item or desktop file command uses su-to-root as
 /usr/sbin/su-to-root. Since sarge su-to-root is located in /usr/bin and
 /usr/sbin/su-to-root is only a compatibility symlink that may get dropped
 in the future.
 .
 Since su-to-root is now located in /usr/bin you can use it without
 absolute path now.

Tag: su-wrapper-not-su-to-root
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item or desktop file command uses an su wrapper other than
 su-to-root. On Debian systems, please use <tt>su-to-root -X</tt>, which
 will pick the correct wrapper based on what's installed on the system and
 the current desktop environment. Using su-to-root is also important for
 Live CD systems which need to use sudo rather than su. su-to-root
 permits global configuration to use sudo.

Tag: menu-item-needs-dwww
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item has needs=dwww. This is deprecated. Instead, you should
 register your documentation with doc-base, and dwww entries will be 
 automatically generated.

Tag: non-wm-in-windowmanager-menu-section
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item is in the Window Manager section but does not needs=wm.
 Either it is a window manager and it should needs=wm, either it isn't and
 then it must be moved in another section.

Tag: non-wm-module-in-wm-modules-menu-section
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item is in the FVWM Modules or Window Maker section but
 does not declare that it needs a specific window manager (using the needs
 key in the menu file). Modules for Fvwm should have needs="fvwmmodule".
 Modules for WindowMaker should have needs="wmmaker".

Tag: unquoted-string-in-menu-item
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The menu item includes a tag with an unquoted string like section=Games
 instead of section="Games". This is deprecated. Use a quoted string instead.
Ref: menu 3.2

Tag: menu-command-not-in-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The menu item specifies a command which is not available in the package.
 In most cases this is a typo or after you moved a binary around, but forgot
 to update the menu file.

Tag: executable-desktop-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The desktop entry file is marked executable. Desktop entries are
 regular files and should be installed mode 0644.

Tag: desktop-entry-file-has-crs
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The desktop entry file has lines ending in CRLF instead of just LF.
 The Desktop Entry Specification is explicit that lines should end with
 only LF. The CR may be taken by some software as part of the field.
 .
 Running the following command against the given file removes any
 <tt>CR</tt> character in the file:
 .
 <tt>sed -i 's/\r//g' path/to/file</tt>
Ref: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s03.html

Tag: duplicated-key-in-desktop-entry
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The desktop entry contains two instances of the same key. The
 behavior of such desktop entries is not well-defined by the standard.
 .
 The desktop-file-validate tool in the desktop-file-utils package is
 useful for checking the syntax of desktop entries.

Tag: desktop-entry-missing-required-key
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Desktop entries must contain, at a minimum, the keys Type and Name.
 .

 useful for checking the syntax of desktop entries.
Ref: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html

Tag: desktop-entry-contains-unknown-key
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The key on this line of the desktop entry is not one of the standard
 keys defined in the FreeDesktop specification, not one of the legacy KDE
 keywords, and one that does not begin with <tt>X-</tt>. It's most likely
 that the key was misspelled.
 .

Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The key on this line of the desktop entry has been deprecated in the
 FreeDesktop specification.

Tag: desktop-entry-contains-encoding-key
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: The Encoding key is now deprecated by the FreeDesktop standard and
 all strings are required to be encoded in UTF-8. This desktop entry
 explicitly specifies an Encoding of UTF-8, which is harmless but no
 longer necessary.
 .

Tag: desktop-entry-lacks-main-category
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The categories for this desktop entry do not contain any Main
 Categories, only Additional Categories. Additional Categories should
 only be used on conjunction with one or more Main Categories.

Tag: desktop-entry-lacks-icon-entry
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This .desktop file does not contain an "Icon" entry.
 .
 "Icon" is the name of the file (without the extension) of the icon displayed
 by this .desktop file. The icon is searched in the different icon themes.
 If the name is an absolute path, the given file will be used.
 The icon should be unique enough to help the user to recognise the application.

Tag: desktop-entry-lacks-keywords-entry
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This .desktop file does either not contain a "Keywords" entry or it does
 not contain any keywords not already present in the "Name" or
 "GenericName" entries.
 .
 .desktop files are organized in key/value pairs (similar to .ini files).
 "Keywords" is the name of the entry/key in the .desktop file containing
 keywords relevant for this .desktop file.

Tag: desktop-entry-uses-reserved-category
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This desktop entry includes a Reserved Category, one which has a
 desktop-specific meaning that has not yet been standardized, but does not
 include an OnlyShowIn key. Desktop entries using a Reserved Category
 must include an OnlyShowIn key limiting the entry to those environments
 that support the category.

Tag: desktop-entry-invalid-category
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This desktop entry lists a category that is not one of the
 registered Main or Additional Categories in the FreeDesktop
 specification. Note that case is significant and whitespace is only
 allowed immediately before and after the equal sign in the Category key,
 not elsewhere in the field.

Ref: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html

Tag: desktop-command-not-in-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The desktop entry specifies a command that is not available in the
 package. In most cases, this is a typo or a forgotten update of the
 desktop file after the install location of the binary was changed. A
 desktop file for a command should be included in the same package as that
 command.

Tag: desktop-contains-deprecated-key
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The key on this line of the desktop entry has been deprecated in the
 FreeDesktop specification. If the key is "KDE Desktop Entry", the right
 fix is normally changing it to "Desktop Entry".
 .

 useful for checking the syntax of desktop entries.
Ref: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/apc.html

Tag: desktop-mime-but-no-exec-code
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The desktop entry lists support for at least one mime type, but does not
 provide codes like %f, %F, %u or %U for the Exec key.
 .
 If the application can indeed handle files of the listed mime types, it should
 specify a way to pass the filenames as parameters.

Tag: desktop-entry-limited-to-environments
Severity: normal
Certainty: wild-guess
Info: This desktop entry uses OnlyShowIn to limit the environments in
 which it's displayed but lists multiple environments. This is often a
 sign of a desktop file written assuming that only GNOME, KDE, and Xfce
 are in use and the desktop file intended to exclude one of them. This
 unintentionally hides the application from desktop environments such as
 LXDE where it would work fine. If this application supports any desktop
 environment except some specific ones, it should list the unsupported
 environments in the NotShowIn key instead.

Tag: command-in-menu-file-and-desktop-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The command is listed both in a menu file and a desktop file
 .
 Per the tech-ctte decision on #741573, this is now prohibited.
 .
 Please remove the menu file from the package.
