Check-Script: conffiles

Needs-Info: bin-pkg-control, unpacked
Info: This script checks if the conffiles control file of a binary
 package is correct.

Tag: file-in-usr-marked-as-conffile
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.7.2
Info: All configuration files must reside in <tt>/etc</tt>. Files below
 <tt>/usr</tt> may not be marked as conffiles since <tt>/usr</tt> might be
 mounted read-only. The local system administrator would therefore not
 have a chance to modify this configuration file.

Tag: non-etc-file-marked-as-conffile
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: A file installed in some other directory than <tt>/etc</tt>
 is marked as conffile. A conffile typically implies a configuration
 file, and Policy mandates such files to be in <tt>/etc</tt>.
Ref: policy 10.7.2

Tag: relative-conffile
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 5.1*
Info: All entries in the <tt>debian/conffiles</tt> control file should
 have an absolute path specification.

Tag: duplicate-conffile
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The file is listed more than once in your <tt>debian/conffiles</tt> file.
 Usually, this is because debhelper (dh_installdeb, compat level 3 or higher)
 will add any files in your package located in /etc automatically to the list
 of conffiles, so if you do that manually too, you'll get duplicates.

Tag: file-in-etc-not-marked-as-conffile
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.7
Info: Files in <tt>/etc</tt> must be marked conffiles if they are included
 in a package. Otherwise they should be created by maintainer scripts.

Tag: file-in-etc-rc.d-marked-as-conffile
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 9.3.3
Info: The symbolic links in <tt>/etc/rc?.d</tt> may not be marked as conffiles.

Tag: conffile-has-bad-file-type
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: #690051, #690910
Info: The conffiles lists this path, which is not a file. This will
 almost certainly not work.
 .
 Note that dpkg does not support symlinks being conffiles.

Tag: conffile-is-not-in-package
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The conffiles control file lists this path, but the path does
 not appear to exist in the package. Lintian may also emit this tag
 when the file exists, but the canonical name is used in the
 "conffiles" control file (e.g. if a parent segment are symlinks).
 .
 Note that dpkg and Lintian strips all whitespace from the right hand
 side of each line. Thus it is not possible for a file ending with
 trailing whitespace to be marked as a conffile.
