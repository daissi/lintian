Info: The Debian control file should be valid UTF-8, an encoding of
 the Unicode character set.

 There are many ways to convert a control from an obsoleted encoding
 like ISO-8859-1; you may for example use "iconv" like this:
 .
  $ iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 control &gt; control.new
  $ mv control.new control
