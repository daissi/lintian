Check-Script: changelog-file
Author: Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>
Abbrev: chg
Type: binary
Needs-Info: file-info, changelog-file, unpacked
Info: This script checks if a binary package conforms to policy
 with regards to changelog files.
 .
 Each binary package with a /usr/share/doc/&lt;foo&gt; directory must have
 a Debian changelog file in <tt>changelog.Debian.gz</tt> unless the Debian
 changelog and the upstream one is the same file; in this case, it
 must be in <tt>changelog.gz</tt>.
 .
 If there is an upstream changelog file, it must be named
 "changelog.gz".
 .
 Both changelog files should be compressed using "gzip -9".
 Even if they start out small, they will become large with time.

Tag: html-changelog-without-text-version
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: If the upstream changelog file is HTML formatted, a text version
 should also be accessible as "changelog.gz". (This can be created by
 "lynx -dump -nolist")
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: changelog-file-not-compressed
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Changelog files should be compressed using "gzip -9". Even if they
 start out small, they will become large with time.
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: changelog-empty-entry
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The last changelog entry is empty. Please add a description or use
 an UNRELEASED version.
Ref: policy 4.4

Tag: debian-news-file-not-compressed
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: NEWS.Debian files should be compressed using "gzip -9". The file
 must always have the same name.
Ref: devref 6.3.4

Tag: changelog-is-dh_make-template
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The changelog file has an instruction left by dh_make, which has
 not been removed. Example:
 .
   * Initial release (Closes: #nnnn)  &lt;nnnn is the bug number of your ITP&gt;
 .
 The "&lt;... is the bug number ...&gt;" part has not been removed from the
 changelog.

Tag: changelog-not-compressed-with-max-compression
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Changelog files should be compressed using "gzip -9"; i.e., using
 the maximum compression level via the -9 option to gzip.
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: wrong-name-for-changelog-of-native-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The changelog file of a native Debian package (i.e., if there is
 no upstream source) should usually be installed as
 /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/changelog.gz
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: changelog-file-missing-in-native-package
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Each Debian package (which provides a /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>
 directory) has to install a changelog file. Since this package seems
 to be a native Debian package (i.e., there is no upstream source),
 the file should usually be installed as
 /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/changelog.gz
 .
 Note that Lintian may emit this tag if the changelog exists, but it
 does not look like a Debian changelog.
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: wrong-name-for-upstream-changelog
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: If there is an upstream changelog file, it should usually be
 installed as /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/changelog.gz
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: wrong-name-for-debian-changelog-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian changelog file should usually be installed as
 /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/changelog.Debian.gz
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: wrong-name-for-debian-news-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The Debian news file must be installed as
 /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/NEWS.Debian.gz with exactly that capitalization
 or automated tools may not find it correctly.
Ref: devref 6.3.4

Tag: debian-changelog-file-missing
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Each Debian package (which provides a /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>
 directory) has to install a Debian changelog file
 /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/changelog.Debian.gz
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: debian-changelog-file-is-a-symlink
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian changelog file is a symlink to a file in a different
 directory or not found in this package. Please don't do this. It makes
 package checking and manipulation unnecessarily difficult. Because it was
 a symlink, the Debian changelog file was not checked for other
 problems. (Symlinks to another file in /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i> or a
 subdirectory thereof are fine and should not trigger this warning.)
 .
 To refer to the changelog, copyright, and other documentation files of
 another package that this one depends on, please symlink the entire
 /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i> directory rather than individual files.

Tag: debian-changelog-file-missing-or-wrong-name
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Each Debian package (which provides a /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>
 directory) must install a Debian changelog file in
 /usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/changelog.Debian.gz
 .
 A common error is to name the Debian changelog like an upstream changelog
 (/usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/changelog.gz); therefore, Lintian will apply
 further checks to such a file if it exists even after issuing this error.
Ref: policy 12.7

Tag: debian-changelog-file-contains-obsolete-user-emacs-settings
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The add-log-mailing-address variable is no longer honored in
 debian-changelog-mode, and should not appear in packages' changelog
 files. Instead, put something like this in your ~/.emacs:
 .
 (setq debian-changelog-mailing-address "userid@debian.org")

Tag: debian-changelog-file-contains-invalid-email-address
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The changelog file contains an invalid email address: the domain
 needs at least one dot. This looks like a mistake.

Tag: debian-changelog-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 4.4
Info: The Debian changelog file must be valid UTF-8, an encoding of
 the Unicode character set.
 .
 There are many ways to convert a changelog from an obsoleted encoding
 like ISO-8859-1; you may for example use "iconv" like:
 .
  $ iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 changelog &gt; changelog.new
  $ mv changelog.new changelog

Tag: debian-news-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The NEWS.Debian file must be valid UTF-8, an encoding of the Unicode
 character set.
 .
 There are many ways to convert a changelog from an obsoleted encoding
 like ISO-8859-1; you may for example use "iconv" like:
 .
  $ iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 NEWS.Debian &gt; NEWS.Debian.new
  $ mv NEWS.Debian.new NEWS.Debian

Tag: latest-changelog-entry-without-new-date
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The latest Debian changelog entry has either the same or even an
 older date as the entry before.
 .
 This can result in subtle bugs due to the <tt>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</tt>
 environment variable being the same between the older and newer
 versions.

Tag: latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The latest Debian changelog entry has a version number that's either
 the same or smaller than the version number of the entry before.

Tag: latest-debian-changelog-entry-changed-to-native
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The latest package has a Debian native version number, while the
 previous version number was not native. This is usually a mistake made by
 the maintainer by forgetting to append -1 when uploading a new upstream
 version.

Tag: latest-debian-changelog-entry-reuses-existing-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The latest changelog entry has a version that matches one used in
 the specified previous entry. All versions of a source package must be
 unique even after a leading epoch has been stripped off.
 .
 Files generated by the current version of this source package would
 conflict with some historical files. This is because the Debian archive
 does not allow multiple files with the same name and different contents
 and the generated .dsc, .deb, etc. do not embed the epoch in their
 filenames.
 .
 Please pick another version, for example by increasing the Debian
 revision.

Tag: possible-new-upstream-release-without-new-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The most recent changelog entry contains an entry that appears to
 say this is a new upstream release (a comment similar to "new upstream
 release," possibly with a word between "upstream" and "release"), but the
 upstream portion of the package version number didn't change. This may
 indicate that the package version was not updated properly in
 <tt>debian/changelog</tt>.

Tag: experimental-to-unstable-without-comment
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The previous version of this package had a distribution of
 "experimental", this version has a distribution of "unstable", and there's
 apparently no comment about the change of distributions.
 .
 Lintian looks in this version's changelog entry for the phrase "to
 unstable" or "to sid", with or without quotation marks around the
 distribution name.
 .
 This may indicate a mistake in setting the distribution and an accidental
 upload to unstable of a package intended for experimental.

Tag: changelog-distribution-does-not-match-changes-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The target distribution in the most recent entry in this package's
 <tt>debian/changelog</tt> file does not match the target in the generated
 <tt>.changes</tt> file.
 .
 This may indicate a mistake in setting the distribution, an accidental
 upload to unstable of a package intended for experimental, or a mistake
 in invoking <tt>sbuild(1)</tt>.
Ref: #906155, sbuild(1)

Tag: syntax-error-in-debian-changelog
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: While parsing the Debian changelog, a syntax error was found. If
 you have old changelog entries that don't follow the current syntax but
 that you want to keep as-is for the historical record, add the line:
 .
   Old Changelog:
 .
 with no leading whitespace before the legacy entries. This line and
 everything after it will be ignored.
Ref: policy 4.4

Tag: syntax-error-in-debian-news-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: While parsing the NEWS.Debian file, a syntax error was found.
Ref: devref 6.3.4

Tag: improbable-bug-number-in-closes
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The most recent changelog closes a low-numbered bug number.
 While this is distantly possible, it's more likely a typo or a
 placeholder value that mistakenly wasn't filled in.

Tag: wrong-bug-number-in-closes
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Bug numbers can only contain digits.
Ref: policy 4.4

Tag: possible-missing-colon-in-closes
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: To close a bug in the Debian changelog, the word "closes" must be
 followed by a colon. This entry looked like it was intended to close a
 bug, but there's no colon after "closes".
Ref: policy 4.4

Tag: debian-news-entry-has-strange-distribution
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The latest entry in NEWS.Debian has an unusual distribution name.
 This field is ignored by the archive software, so its value doesn't truly
 matter, but it may be confusing to users reading the entry if the
 distribution doesn't match the distribution for the same entry in the
 Debian changelog file.

Tag: debian-news-entry-uses-asterisk
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: The latest entry in NEWS.Debian appears to use asterisks to present
 changes in a bulleted list, similar to the normal changelog syntax. The
 Debian Developer's Reference recommends using regular paragraphs in
 NEWS.Debian rather than a bulleted list.
Ref: devref 6.3.4

Tag: debian-news-entry-has-unknown-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The version number of the most recent <tt>NEWS.Debian</tt> entry
 does not match any of the version numbers in the changelog file for this
 package. This usually means the version in <tt>NEWS.Debian</tt> needs to
 be updated to match a change to package version that happened after the
 <tt>NEWS.Debian</tt> entry was written.

Tag: spelling-error-in-changelog
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: Lintian found a spelling error in the latest entry of the Debian
 changelog. Lintian has a list of common misspellings that it looks for.
 It does not have a dictionary like a spelling checker does.
 .
 When writing a changelog entry for a spelling fix that includes the
 misspelling, ensure the word "spelling" is on the same line as the
 misspelled word to avoid triggering this warning.

Tag: spelling-error-in-news-debian
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: Lintian found a spelling error in the latest entry of the
 NEWS.Debian file. Lintian has a list of common misspellings that it
 looks for. It does not have a dictionary like a spelling checker does.

Tag: new-package-should-close-itp-bug
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to be the first packaging of a new upstream
 software package (there is only one changelog entry and the Debian
 revision is 1), but it does not close any bugs. The initial upload of a
 new package should close the corresponding ITP bug for that package.
 .
 This warning can be ignored if the package is not intended for Debian or
 if it is a split of an existing Debian package.
Ref: devref 5.1

Tag: debian-changelog-line-too-long
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The given line of the latest changelog entry is over 80 columns.
 Such changelog entries may look poor in terminal windows and mail
 messages and be annoying to read. Please wrap changelog entries at 80
 columns or less where possible.

Tag: debian-changelog-line-too-short
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The given line of the latest changelog entry appears to contain a
 very terse entry.
 .
 This can make it hard for others to understand the changelog entry.
 Please keep in mind that:
 .
  * It is not uncommon that people read changelog entries that are more
    than a decade old to understand why a change was made or why a
    package works in a specific way.
  * Many users will read the changelog via
    <tt>apt-listchanges(1)</tt>
  * The information in <tt>debian/changelog</tt> is permanent.
 .
 Examples for too short entries include "dh 11" or simply "R³" - these
 could be expanded to, for example:
 .
  * Switch to debhelper compat 11.
  * Set Rules-Requires-Root: no.

Tag: changelog-news-debian-mismatch
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The latest entries in the Debian changelog file and NEWS.Debian file
 are for the same version but the given field doesn't match. The
 changelog information is canonical and the NEWS.Debian information is
 ignored, but it may be confusing to users to have them be different.

Tag: bad-intended-distribution
Severity: normal
Certainty: wild-guess
Experimental: yes
Info: The last changelog entry implies this version is not for release.
    Instead it should specify the distribution it is to be uploaded to.

Tag: non-consecutive-debian-revision
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Experimental: yes
Info: The last changelog entry refer to a Debian revision that is not
 consecutive to previous changelog entry. Please use consecutive Debian
 revision or use UNRELEASED version.

Tag: misspelled-closes-bug
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 5.6.22
Info: The last changelog entry uses Close: #123456 instead of correct
 Closes: #123456

Tag: version-refers-to-distribution
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian portion of the package version contains a reference to a
 particular Debian release or distribution. This should only be done for
 uploads targeted at a particular release, not at unstable or
 experimental, and should refer to the release by version number or code
 name.
 .
 Using "testing" or "stable" in a package version targeted at the current
 testing or stable release is less informative than using the code name or
 version number and may cause annoying version sequencing issues if the
 package doesn't change before the next release cycle starts.
Ref: devref 5.14.3

Tag: debian-changelog-has-wrong-day-of-week
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The date in the changelog entry is not consistent with the actual
 day of that week. Either the date is wrong or the day of week is wrong.
 .
 To avoid problems like this, consider using a tool like dch(1) or
 date(1) to generate the date. Example:
 .
   $ date -R -ud '2013-11-05 23:59:59'
   Tue, 05 Nov 2013 23:59:59 +0000

Tag: changelog-references-temp-security-identifier
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The changelog entry references a temporary security identifier,
 like "TEMP-0000000-2FC21E".
 .
 The TEMP identifier will disappear in the future once a proper CVE
 identifier has been assigned. Therefore it is useless as an
 external reference. Even worse, the identifier is not stable and
 may change even before a CVE is allocated.
 .
 If a CVE has been allocated, please use that instead. Otherwise,
 please replace the TEMP identifier with a short description of the
 issue.
Ref: #787929, #807892

Tag: epoch-change-without-comment
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The previous version of this package had a different version epoch
 (eg. 2:1.0-1) to the current version but there's no reference to this in
 the changelog entry.
 .
 Epochs exist to cope with changes to the upstream version numbering
 scheme. Whilst they are a powerful tool, increasing or adding an epoch
 has many downsides including causing issues with versioned dependencies,
 being misleading to users and being aesthetically unappealing. Whilst
 they should be avoided, valid reasons to add or increment the epoch
 include:
 .
  - Upstream changed their versioning scheme in a way that makes the
    latest version lower than the previous one.
  - You need to permanently revert to a lower upstream version.
 .
 Temporary revertions (eg. after an NMU) should use not modify or
 introduce an epoch - please use the <tt>CURRENT+reallyFORMER</tt> until
 you can upload the latest version again.
 .
 If you are unsure whether you need to increase the epoch for a package,
 please consult the debian-devel mailing list.
 .
 Lintian looks in this version's changelog entry for the phrase "epoch".

Tag: epoch-changed-but-upstream-version-did-not-go-backwards
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The previous version of this package had a different version epoch
 to the current version but the upstream version did not go "backwards".
 For example, the previous package version was "1:1.0-1" and the current
 version is "2:2.0-1".
 .
 This was likely an accidental bump or addition of an epoch.
 .

Tag: invalid-date-in-debian-changelog
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The date format in the latest changelog entry file appears to be invalid.
 .
 Dates should use the following format (compatible and with the same semantics
 of RFC 2822 and RFC 5322):
 .
   day-of-week, dd month yyyy hh:mm:ss +zzzz
 .
 To avoid problems like this, consider using a tool like dch(1) or
 date(1) to generate the date. Example:
 .
   $ date -R -ud '2013-11-05 23:59:59'

Tag: changelog-file-missing-explicit-entry
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The latest changelog file for this package specifies a version in
 the form of 1.2-3+deb8u1, 1.2-3+nmu4 (or similar) but this does not
 follow from a corresponding 1.2-3 changelog stanza.
 .
 This suggests that changes were merged into a single entry. This is
 suboptimal as it makes it more difficult for users to determine which
 upload fixed a particular bug.
