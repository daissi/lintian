Tag: missing-depends-line
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Check: binaries
Info: The package contains an ELF binary with dynamic dependencies,
 but does not have a Depends line in its control file. This usually
 means that a call to <tt>dpkg-shlibdeps</tt> is missing from the
 package's <tt>debian/rules</tt> file.
