Severity: error
Check: binaries
Info: This package includes an "R" programming language package.
 Such packages must depend on r-api-<i>N</i>.
 .
 If the package is using debhelper, this problem is usually due to a
 missing <tt>--buildsystem=R</tt> call in <tt>debian/rules</tt> or a missing
 ${R:Depends} substitution variable in the Depends line in
 <tt>debian/control</tt>.
