Tag: r-data-without-readme-source
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Many modules packaged for the R Project for Statistical Computing contain
 data files with names as *.rda, *.Rda, *.rdata, *.Rdata, etc.
 .
 When such files exist, the FTP masters expect them to be explained in
 debian/README.source, which this package is missing.
 .
 Please add a README.source documenting the origins of these files.
