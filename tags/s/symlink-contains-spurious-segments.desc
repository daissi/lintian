Tag: symlink-contains-spurious-segments
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Check: files

 middle. These are unneeded and make the link longer than it could be,
 which is in violation of policy. They can also cause problems in the
 presence of symlinked directories.

 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.
