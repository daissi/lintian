=head1 NAME

Lintian::Lab -- Interface to the Lintian Lab

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Lintian::Lab;
 
 # Static lab
 my $lab = Lintian::Lab->new ('/var/lib/lintian/static-lab');

 if (!$lab->exists) {
     $lab->create;
 }
 $lab->open;
 
 # Fetch a package from the lab
 my $lpkg = $lab->get_package ('lintian', 'binary', '2.5.4', 'all');
 
 my $visitor = sub {
     my ($lpkg, $pkg_name, $pkg_ver, $pkg_arch) = @_;
     # do stuff with that entry
 };
 $lab->visit_packages ($visitor, 'source');
 
 $lab->close;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an abstraction from "How and where" packages are
placed.  It handles creation and deletion of the Lintian Lab itself as
well as providing access to the entries.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new ([DIR])

Creates a new Lab instance.  If DIR is defined it will be used as
the path to the lab and the lab will be in static mode.  Otherwise the
lab will be in temporary mode and will point to a temporary directory.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item dir

Returns the absolute path to the base of the lab.

Note: This may return the empty string if either the lab has been
deleted or this is a temporary lab that has not been created yet.  In
the latter case, L</create> or L</open> should be run to get a
non-empty value from this method.

=item is_open

Returns a truth value if this lab is open.

Note: If the lab is open, it also exists.  However, if the lab is
closed then the lab may or may not exist (see L</exists>).

=cut

Lintian::Lab->mk_ro_accessors(qw(dir is_open));

=item exists

Returns a truth value if the instance points to an existing lab.

Note: This never implies that the lab is open.  Though it may imply
the lab is closed (see L</is_open>).

=cut

sub exists {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $dir = $self->dir;
    return unless $dir;
    # New style lab?
    return 1 if -d "$dir/info" && -d "$dir/pool";
    # 10-style lab?
    return
         -d "$dir/binary"
      && -d "$dir/udeb"
      && -d "$dir/source"
      && -d "$dir/info";
}

=item get_package (NAME, TYPE[, EXTRA]), get_package (PROC)

Fetches an existing package from the lab.

The first argument can be a L<processable|Lintian::Processable>.  In that
case all other arguments are ignored.

If the first calling convention is used then this method will search
for an existing package.  The EXTRA argument can be used to narrow
the search or even to add a new entry.

EXTRA consists of (in order):

=over 4

=item * version

=item * arch (ignored if TYPE is "source")

=back

If version or arch is omitted (or if it is undef) then that search
parameter is consider a wildcard for "any".  Example:

 # Returns all eclipse-platform packages with architecture i386 regardless
 # of their version (if any)
 @ps  = $lab->get_package ('eclipse-platform', 'binary', undef, 'i386');
 # Returns all eclipse-platform packages with version 3.5.2-11 regardless
 # of their architecture (if any)
 @ps  = $lab->get_package ('eclipse-platform', 'binary', '3.5.2-11');
 # Return the eclipse-platform package with version 3.5.2-11 and architecture
 # i386 (or undef)
 $pkg = $lab->get_package ('eclipse-platform', 'binary', '3.5.2-11', 'i386');


In list context, this returns a list of matches.  In scalar context
this returns the first match (if any).  Note there is no guaranteed
order (e.g. the returned list is not ordered).

If the second calling convention is used, then this method will search
for an entry matching the processable passed.  If such an entry
does not exists, a new "non-existing" L<entry|Lintian::Lab::Entry>
will be returned.  This entry can be created by using the
L<create|Lintian::Lab::Entry/create> method on the entry.

=item lab_query (QUERY)

Process a given QUERY and return the results from it.  A QUERY is a string
of the format:

  [TYPE:]NAME[/VERSION[/ARCH]]

TYPE can be one of the regular package type (e.g. "binary") or one of
the two special values "ALL" (default if omitted) or "GROUP".  If TYPE
is ALL, then the query is one once for each of package type.

NAME is the name of the package to request.  For GROUP queries, this
is the name of the source package.  It is not possible to do any kind
of wildcards in NAME:

VERSION is the version of the package.  For GROUP queries, this is the
version of the source package.  If omitted or the string '_',
then any version will match.

ARCH is the architecture of the package.  For GROUP and "source"
queries, ARCH is ignored (if given).  If ARCH is omitted or the string
'_', then any package architecture will match.  NB: The ARCH field
should match the architecture field of the entry (which for
I<.changes> files usually contains spaces).

lab_query will return a list of L<entries|Lintian::Lab::Entry>
matching the query.  If no entries match, an empty list will be
returned.

=item repair

Checks the lab contents against the current meta-data and syncs them.
The lab must be open and should not be access while this method is
running.

This returns the number of corrections done by this process.  If there
were any corrections, the state files are written before returning.

The method may croak if it is unable to do a full check of the lab or
if it is unable to write the corrected metadata.

Note: This may (and generally will) correct "broken" entries by
removing them.

=item create ([OPTS])

Creates a new lab.  It will create L</dir> if it does not exist.
It will also create a basic empty lab.  If this is a temporary
lab, this method will also setup the temporary dir for the lab.

The lab will I<not> be opened by this method.  This should be done
afterwards by invoking the L</open> method.

OPTS (if present) is a hashref containing options.  The following
options are accepted:

=over 4

=item keep-lab

If "keep-lab" points to a truth value the temporary directory will
I<not> be removed by closing the lab (nor exiting the application).
However, explicitly calling L</remove> will remove the lab.

=item mode

If present, this will be used as mode for creating directories.  Will
default to 0777 if not specified.  It is passed to mkdir and is thus
subject to umask settings.

=back

Note: This will not create parent directories of L</dir> and will
croak if these does not exist.

Note: This may update the value of L</dir> as resolving the path
requires it to exist.

Note: This does nothing if the lab appears to already exists.

Opens the lab and reads the contents into caches.  If the lab is
temporary and does not exists, this method will call create to

Note: for static labs, L</dir> must point to an existing consistent
lab or this will croak.  To open a new lab, please use L</create>.

Note: It is not possible to pass options to the creation of the
temporary lab.  If special options are required, please use
L</create> directly.

Close the lab - all state caches will be flushed to the disk and the

=item remove

Removes the lab and everything in it.  Any reference to an entry
returned from this lab will immediately become invalid.

If this is a temporary lab, the lab root dir (as returned L</dir>)
will be removed as well on success.  Otherwise the lab root dir will
not be removed by this call.

On success, this will return a truth value.  If the lab is a temporary
lab, the directory path will be set to the empty string (that is,
L</dir> will return '').

On error, this method will croak.

If the lab has already been removed (or does not exist), this will
return a truth value.

=head1 Changes to the lab format.

Lab formats up to (and including) "10" used to store the lab format
with each entry.  The files in $LAB/info/ were used to list packages
from a mirror (dist).

In lab format 11 the lab format is stored in $LAB/info/lab-info.  The
rest of the files in $LAB/info/* have been re-purposed to be a list of
packages in the lab.

The $LAB/info/lab-info is parsed as a debian control file (See Debian
Policy Manual §5.1 for syntax).  The consists of a single paragraph
and only the following fields are allowed:

=over 4

=item Lab-Format (simple, mandatory)

This field contains the lab format of this lab.  Generally this is
simply an integer (though during development non-integers have been
used).

=item Layout (simple, optional)

The layout parameter describes how packages are stored in the lab.
Currently the only accepted value is "pool" and the value is not
case-sensitive.

The pool format dictates that packages are stored in:

 pool/$l/${name}/${name}_${version}[_${arch}]_${type}/

Note that $arch is left out for source packages, $l is the first
letter of the package name (except if the name starts with "lib", then
it is the first 4 letters of the package name).  Whitespace (e.g. "
") are replaced with dashes ("-") and colons (":") with underscores
("_").

If the field is missing, it defaults to "pool".

=back

It is allowed to use comments in $LAB/info/lab-info as described
in the Debian Policy Manual §5.1.
