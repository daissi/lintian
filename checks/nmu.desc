Check-Script: nmu

Abbrev: nmu
Type: source
Needs-Info: unpacked
Info: This script checks if a source package is consistent about its NMU-ness.

Tag: orphaned-package-should-not-have-uploaders
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages with their maintainer set to packages@qa.debian.org, i.e.
 orphaned packages, should not have uploaders. Adopt the package properly if
 you want to resume its maintenance.

Tag: qa-upload-has-incorrect-version-number
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: A QA upload (uploading an orphaned package without adopting it) is
 always a maintainer upload: it should not get a NMU revision number.

Tag: team-upload-has-incorrect-version-number
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: A team upload (uploading a package from the same team without adding
 oneself as maintainer or uploader) is a maintainer upload: it should not
 get a NMU revision number. Team uploads are recognized by the string
 "team upload" on the first line of the changelog file.

Tag: unnecessary-team-upload
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/changelog</tt> file refers to a "Team upload" but the
 uploader is listed amongst the Maintainer/Uploaders.

Tag: source-nmu-has-incorrect-version-number
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: A source NMU should have a Debian revision of "-x.x" (or "+nmuX" for a
 native package). This is to prevent stealing version numbers from the
 maintainer.
 .
 Maybe you didn't intend this upload to be a NMU, in that case, please
 double-check that the most recent entry in the changelog is byte-for-byte
 identical to the maintainer or one of the uploaders. If this is a local
 package (not intended for Debian), you can suppress this warning by
 putting "local" in the version number or "local package" on the first
 line of the changelog entry.

Tag: maintainer-upload-has-incorrect-version-number
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: A maintainer upload should have a Debian revision without dots.
 Revisions with dots are reserved for Non-Maintainer Uploads (NMU's), if you
 do a maintainer-upload with dots, a potential NMU'er has problems choosing a
 correct version number.

Tag: changelog-should-mention-qa
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: If this upload is to orphan this package, please mention this fact on
 the first line of the changelog. If this is a QA upload, please mention "QA
 (group) upload" there.

Tag: changelog-should-mention-nmu
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: When you NMU a package, that fact should be mentioned on the first line
 in the changelog entry. Use the words "NMU" or "Non-maintainer upload"
 (case insensitive).
 .
 Maybe you didn't intend this upload to be a NMU, in that case, please
 double-check that the most recent entry in the changelog is byte-for-byte
 identical to the maintainer or one of the uploaders. If this is a local
 package (not intended for Debian), you can suppress this warning by
 putting "local" in the version number or "local package" on the first
 line of the changelog entry.
Ref: devref 5.11.3

Tag: changelog-should-not-mention-nmu
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The first line of the changelog entry for this package appears to
 indicate it is a non-maintainer upload (by including either that string
 or the string "NMU" and not saying that it's an acknowledgement), but the
 changelog indicates the person making this release is one of the
 maintainers.
 .
 If this was intended to be an NMU, do not add yourself as a maintainer or
 uploader. Otherwise, please rephrase your changelog entry to not cause
 confusion.

Tag: changelog-is-symlink
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The file <tt>debian/changelog</tt> is a symlink instead of a regular
 file. This is unnecessary and makes package checking and manipulation
 more difficult. If the changelog should be available in the source
 package under multiple names, make <tt>debian/changelog</tt> the real
 file and the other names symlinks to it.
 .
 This problem may have prevented Lintian from performing other checks,
 leading to undetected changelog errors.

Tag: extra-whitespace-around-name-in-changelog-trailer
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: There is too much whitespace around the name in debian/changelog.
 .
 The format is:
   -- NAME &lt;EMAIL&gt;  DATE
 .
 Note that there must be exactly 1 space after the "--" and exactly
 2 spaces before the "DATE".
