Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Symlinks to files which are in the same top-level directory should be

 file in /usr should be relative, while a link in /usr to a file in /etc
 should be absolute.)

 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.
