Lintian::Tags - Manipulate and output Lintian tags

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $tags = Lintian::Tags->new;
    my $proc = Lintian::Processable->new;
    $proc->init_from_file('/path/to/file');
    $tags->file_start ($proc);
    $tags->file_overrides ('/path/to/an/overrides-file');
    $tags->tag ('lintian-tag', 'extra tag information');
    tag ('other-lintian-tag', 'with some extra data');
    tag ('third-lintian-tag'); # with no extra).
    my %overrides = $tags->overrides ($proc);
    my %stats = $tags->statistics;
    if ($tags->displayed ('lintian-tag')) {
        # do something if that tag would be displayed...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module stores metadata about Lintian tags, stores configuration about
which tags should be displayed, handles displaying tags if appropriate,
and stores cumulative statistics about what tags have been seen.  It also
accepts override information and determines whether a tag has been
overridden, keeping override statistics.  Finally, it supports answering
metadata questions about Lintian tags, such as what references Lintian has
for that tag.

Each Lintian::Tags object has its own tag list, file list, and associated
statistics.  Separate Lintian::Tags objects can be maintained and used
independently.  However, as a convenience for Lintian's most typical use
case and for backward compatibility, the first created Lintian::Tags
object is maintained as a global default.  The tag() method can be called
as a global function instead of a method, in which case it will act on
that global default Lintian::Tags object.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new()

Creates a new Lintian::Tags object, initializes all of its internal
statistics and configuration to the defaults, and returns the newly
created object.

=cut

#'# for cperl-mode

# Each Lintian::Tags object holds the following information:
#
# current:
#     The currently selected file (not package), keying into files.
#
# display_level:
#     A two-level hash with severity as the first key and certainty as the
#     second key, with values 0 (do not show tag) or 1 (show tag).  This
#
# display_source:
#     A hash of sources to display, where source is the keyword from a Ref
#     metadata entry in the tag.  This is used to select only tags from
#     Policy, or devref, or so forth.
#
# files:
#     Info about a specific file.  Key is the filename, value another
#     hash with the following keys:
#      - pkg: package name
#      - version: package version
#      - arch: package architecture
#      - type: one of 'binary', 'udeb' or 'source'
#      - overrides: hash with all overrides for this file as keys
#
# profile:
#     The Lintian::Profile (if any).  If not undef, this is used to
#     determine known tags, severity of tags (indirectly) and whether
#     or not a given tag is overridable.  It also partly affects
#     which tags are suppressed (see the suppressed method below).
#
# show_experimental:
#     True if experimental tags should be displayed.  False by default.
#
# show_overrides:
#     True if overridden tags should be displayed.  False by default.
#
# statistics:
#     Statistics per file.  Key is the filename, value another hash with
#     the following keys:
#      - tags: hash of tag names to count of times seen
#      - severity: hash of severities to count of times seen
#      - certainty: hash of certainties to count of times seen
#      - types: hash of tag code (E/W/I/P) to count of times seen
#      - overrides: hash whose keys and values are the same as the above
#     The overrides hash holds the tag data for tags that were overridden.
#     Data for overridden tags is not added to the regular hashes.

=item tag(TAG, [EXTRA, ...])

Issue the Lintian tag TAG, possibly suppressing it or not displaying it
based on configuration.  EXTRA, if present, is additional information to
display with the tag.  It can be given as a list of strings, in which case
they're joined by a single space before display.

This method can be called either as a class method (which is exported by
the Lintian::Tags module) or as an instance method.  If called as a class
method, it uses the first-constructed Lintian::Tags object as its
underlying object.

This method throws an exception if it is called without file_start() being
called first or if an attempt is made to issue an unknown tag.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 Configuration

=over 4

=item display(OPERATION, RELATION, SEVERITY, CERTAINTY)

Configure which tags are displayed by severity and certainty.  OPERATION
is C<+> to display the indicated tags, C<-> to not display the indicated
tags, or C<=> to not display any tags except the indicated ones.  RELATION
is one of C<< < >>, C<< <= >>, C<=>, C<< >= >>, or C<< > >>.  The
OPERATION will be applied to all pairs of severity and certainty that
match the given RELATION on the SEVERITY and CERTAINTY arguments.  If
either of those arguments are undefined, the action applies to any value
for that variable.  For example:

    $tags->display('=', '>=', 'important');

turns off display of all tags and then enables display of any tag (with
any certainty) of severity important or higher.

    $tags->display('+', '>', 'normal', 'possible');

adds to the current configuration display of all tags with a severity
higher than normal and a certainty higher than possible (so
important/certain and serious/certain).

    $tags->display('-', '=', 'minor', 'possible');

turns off display of tags of severity minor and certainty possible.

This method throws an exception on errors, such as an unknown severity or
certainty or an impossible constraint (like C<< > serious >>).

Limits the displayed tags to only those from the listed sources.  One or

non-overridable.

to the overrides hash in the info hash entry for the current file.

file_start() must be called before this method.  This method throws an

file cannot be opened.

=item overrides(PROC)

Returns a reference to the overrides hash for the given processable.  The keys of
this hash are the tags for which are overrides.  The value for each key is
another hash, whose keys are the extra data matched by that override and
whose values are the counts of tags that matched that override.  Overrides
matching any tag by that name are stored with the empty string as
metadata, so:

    my $overrides = $tags->overrides('/some/file');
    print "$overrides->{'some-tag'}{''}\n";

will print out the number of tags that matched a general override for the
tag some-tag, regardless of what extra data was associated with it.

    }
    return;
}

=item statistics([PROC])

Returns a reference to the statistics hash for the given processable or, if PROC
is omitted, a reference to the full statistics hash for all files.  In the
latter case, the returned hash reference has as keys the file names and as
values the per-file statistics.

The per-file statistics has a set of hashes of keys to times seen in tags:
tag names (the C<tags> key), severities (the C<severity> key), certainties
(the C<certainty> key), and tag codes (the C<types> key).  It also has an
C<overrides> key which has as its value another hash with those same four
keys, which keeps statistics on overridden tags (not included in the
regular counts).

=item displayed(TAG)

Returns true if the given tag would be displayed given the current
configuration, false otherwise.  This does not check overrides, only whether
the tag severity, certainty, and source warrants display given the
configuration.

}

=item suppressed(TAG)

Returns true if the given tag would be suppressed given the current
configuration, false otherwise.  This is different than displayed() in
that a tag is only suppressed if Lintian treats the tag as if it's never
been seen, doesn't update statistics, and doesn't change its exit status.
Tags are suppressed via profile().

=item ignored_overrides()

Returns a hash of tags, for which overrides have been ignored.  The
keys are tag names and the value is the number of overrides that has
been ignored.
