Check-Script: java
Author: Vincent Fourmond <fourmond@debian.org>
Abbrev: java
Type: binary, source
Needs-Info: java-info, unpacked
Info: This script checks if the packages comply with various aspects of the
 Debian Java policy.

Tag: classpath-contains-relative-path
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The classpath listed in the jar file refers to a potential
 missing jar file.  This could be the remnants of a build-time
 classpath that are not relevant for a JAR bundled in a Debian
 package.
 .
 Alternatively, the classpath may be correct, but the package is
 lacking a jar file or a symlink to it.
 .
 Note, Lintian assumes that all (relative) classpaths pointing to
 /usr/share/java/ (but not subdirs thereof) are satisfied by
 dependencies as long as there is at least one strong libX-java
 dependency.

Tag: jar-not-in-usr-share
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: java-policy 2.2, java-policy 2.3
Info: The classpath listed in some of the files references files outside
 of /usr/share, while all installed JAR files must be within
 /usr/share/java for libraries or /usr/share/<i>package</i> for JARs for
 private use.
 .
 The rationale is that jar files are in almost all cases architecture
 independent and therefore should be in /usr/share.  If the jar file is
 truly architecture dependent or it cannot be moved since symlinked jar
 files are not accepted by the application, then please override this
 tag.

Tag: maven-plugin-in-usr-share-java
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: A maven plugin is incorrectly installed in /usr/share/java.
 Maven plugins should be installed in /usr/share/maven-repo

Tag: executable-jar-without-main-class
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: java-policy 2.2
Info: An executable JAR must have a Main-Class set in its manifest.

Tag: missing-dep-on-jarwrapper
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: java-policy 2.2
Info: Packages containing an executable JAR must depend on jarwrapper or
 other packages providing similar functionalities.

Tag: javalib-but-no-public-jars
Severity: minor
Certainty: possible
Info: The name of the package suggests that it contains a java library but
 it does not contain any JAR file in /usr/share/java, while the java policy
 mandates that JAR files outside /usr/share/java are for private use.

Tag: missing-manifest
Severity: minor
Certainty: possible
Info: The jar file contains .class files but no manifest. This may
 indicate a build misconfiguration.

Tag: codeless-jar
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The jar file contains a manifest but no code. This probably indicates
 that something went wrong at build-time.

Tag: incompatible-java-bytecode-format
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package contains Java class files with a minimum requirement on the
 listed Java version.  This Java version is not supported by the default JVM
 in Debian and is therefore likely to be a mistake.
Ref: #673276

Tag: unknown-java-class-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a Jar file with Java class files compiled for an
 unknown Java version.  Most likely the class file is corrupt or compiled
 for a newer version of Java than Lintian knows about.  In the latter case,
 please file a bug against Lintian.
 .
 The latest class version known by Lintian is Java11 (Major version 55).

Tag: zip-parse-error
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a Jar file, but Lintian is unable to parse it.
 It is possible that the Jar file is corrupt.

Tag: bad-jar-name
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package ships the specified "public" Jar file under
 <tt>/usr/share/java/</tt>, but the name does not correspond to Java policy
 guidelines. This can cause tools in the Debian Java toolchain to fail.
Ref: java-policy 2.4

Tag: jar-contains-source
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package ships the specified Jar file containing a
 <tt>.java</tt> file alongside a corresponding <tt>.class</tt> file.
 .
 This wastes disk space as the source is always available via <tt>apt
 source</tt>.
 .
 Please ensure that the specified <tt>.java</tt> files are not shipped in
 the Jar file.
Ref: java-policy 2.4

Tag: source-contains-prebuilt-java-object
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The source tarball contains a prebuilt Java class file.  These are often
 included by mistake when developers generate a tarball without cleaning
 the source directory first.  If there is no sign this was intended,
 consider reporting it as an upstream bug.
