Tag: description-starts-with-leading-spaces
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package's extended "Description:" paragraph starts with more than
 one leading space. Usually, leading spaces are used to switch "verbatim
 display" on (i.e., lines are not wrapped) so this might be a bug in the
 package.
