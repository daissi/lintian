Tag: script-with-language-extension
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: When scripts are installed into a directory in the system PATH, the
 script name should not include an extension such as <tt>.sh</tt> or
 <tt>.pl</tt> that denotes the scripting language currently used to
 implement it. The implementation language may change; if it does,
 leaving the name the same would be confusing and changing it would be
 disruptive.
