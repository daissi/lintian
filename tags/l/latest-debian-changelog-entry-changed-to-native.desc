Tag: latest-debian-changelog-entry-changed-to-native
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The latest package has a Debian native version number, while the
 previous version number was not native. This is usually a mistake made by
 the maintainer by forgetting to append -1 when uploading a new upstream
 version.
