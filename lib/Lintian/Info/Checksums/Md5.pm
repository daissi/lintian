=head1 NAME

Lintian::Info::Checksums::Md5 - access to collected md5 data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use autodie;
    use Lintian::Collect;
    
    my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'source', '/path/to/lab-entry');
    my $info = Lintian::Collect::Binary->new($name);
    my $filename = "etc/conf.d/$name.conf";
    my $file = $info->index_resolved_path($filename);
    if ($file and $file->is_open_ok) {
        my $fd = $info->open;
        # Use $fd ...
        close($fd);
    } elsif ($file) {
        print "$file is available, but is not a file or unsafe to open\n";
    } else {
        print "$file is missing\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Info::Package provides part of an interface to package
data for source and binary packages.  It implements data collection
methods specific to all packages that can be unpacked (or can contain
files)

This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data from
files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates that
data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all data about
source packages via this module so that the module can cache data where
appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of caching that
data in memory.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

In addition to the instance methods listed below, all instance methods
documented in the L<Lintian::Collect> module are also available.

=item md5sums

Returns a hashref mapping a FILE to its md5sum.  The md5sum is
computed by Lintian during extraction and is not guaranteed to match
the md5sum in the "md5sums" control file.
