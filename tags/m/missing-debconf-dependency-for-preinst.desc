Tag: missing-debconf-dependency-for-preinst
Severity: warning
Certainty: possible
Check: debian/debconf
Info: Packages using debconf in their preinst script must pre-depend
 on debconf, with appropriate discussion on &debdev;. Since debconf is
 almost always already installed, this is normally better than depending
 on it and falling back to a different configuration system.
