=head1 NAME

Lintian::Collect - Lintian interface to package data collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'udeb', '/some/abs/path');
    my $collect = Lintian::Collect->new ($name, $type, $dir);
    $name = $collect->name;
    $type = $collect->type;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Collect provides the shared interface to package data used by
source, binary and udeb packages and .changes files.  It creates an
object of the appropriate type and provides common functions used by the
collection interface to all types of package.

Usually instances should not be created directly (exceptions include
collections), but instead be requested via the
L<info|Lintian::Lab::Entry/info> method in Lintian::Lab::Entry.

This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data from
files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates that
data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all data via
this module and its subclasses so that the module can cache data where
appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of caching that
data in memory.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new (PACKAGE, TYPE, BASEDIR[, FIELDS]))

Creates a new object appropriate to the package type.  TYPE can be
retrieved later with the L</type> method.  Croaks if given an unknown
TYPE.

PACKAGE is the name of the package and is stored in the collect object.
It can be retrieved with the L</name> method.

BASEDIR is the base directory for the data and should be absolute.

If FIELDS is given it is assumed to be the fields from the underlying
control file.  This is only used to avoid an unnecessary read
operation (possibly incl. an ar | gzip pipeline) when the fields are
already known.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

In addition to the instance methods documented here, see the documentation
of L<Lintian::Collect::Source>, L<Lintian::Collect::Binary> and
L<Lintian::Collect::Changes> for instance methods specific to source and
binary / udeb packages and .changes files.

=item name

Returns the name of the package.

    my ($self) = @_;

=item type

Returns the type of the package.

=item base_dir

Returns the base_dir where all the package information is stored.

=cut

sub base_dir {

    return $self->{base_dir};
}

=item lab_data_path ([ENTRY])

Return the path to the ENTRY in the lab.  This is a convenience method
around base_dir.  If ENTRY is not given, this method behaves like
base_dir.

    return "$base/$entry" if $entry;
    return $base;
}

=item unfolded_field (FIELD)

This method returns the unfolded value of the control field FIELD in
the control file for the package.  For a source package, this is the
*.dsc file; for a binary package, this is the control file in the
control section of the package.

If FIELD is passed but not present, then this method returns undef.

sub unfolded_field {
    my ($self, $field) = @_;

    return
      unless defined $field;

    return $self->{'"unfolded"'}{$field}

    my $value = $self->field($field);

    return
      unless defined $value;

    $value =~ s/\n$//;
    if ($value =~ s/\n//g) {

        tag 'multiline-field', $field;

        # Remove leading space as it confuses some of the other checks
        # that are anchored.  This happens if the field starts with a
        # space and a newline, i.e ($ marks line end):
        #
        # Vcs-Browser: $
        #  http://somewhere.com/$
        $value =~ s/^\s*+//;
    }

    $self->{'"unfolded"'}{$field} = $value;

    return $value;
}

=item field ([FIELD[, DEFAULT]])

If FIELD is given, this method returns the value of the control field
FIELD in the control file for the package.  For a source package, this
is the *.dsc file; for a binary package, this is the control file in
the control section of the package.

If FIELD is passed but not present, then this method will return
DEFAULT (if given) or undef.

Otherwise this will return a hash of fields, where the key is the field
name (in all lowercase).

# It must cache the result if possible, since field and fields are called often.
