 WRT to files and directories.

Tag: package-contains-ancient-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Your package contains a file that claims to have been generated
 more than 20 years ago. This is most probably an error. Your package
 will be rejected by the Debian archive scripts if it contains a file
 with such a timestamp.

Tag: package-installs-file-to-usr-x11r6
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages using the X Window System should not be configured to install
 files under the /usr/X11R6/ directory. Debian has switched to the modular
 X tree which now uses regular FHS paths and all packages should follow.
 .
 Programs that use GNU autoconf and automake are usually easily configured
 at compile time to use /usr/ instead of /usr/X11R6/.  Packages that use
 imake must build-depend on xutils-dev (&gt;= 1:1.0.2-2) for the correct
 paths.

Certainty: possible
Info: The directory has a mode different from 0755, and it's not one of the
 known exceptions.
Ref: policy 10.9

Tag: executable-is-not-world-readable
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: All executables should be readable by any user.  Since anyone can
 download the Debian package and obtain a copy of the executable, no
 security is gained by making the executable unreadable even for setuid
 binaries.  If only members of a certain group may execute this file,
 remove execute permission for world, but leave read permission.
Ref: policy 10.9

Tag: non-standard-executable-perm
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Executables that are not setuid or setgid should always have a mode
 of 0755.  Since anyone can obtain the executable by downloading the
 Debian package and extracting it, restricting access serves little
 purpose.
Ref: policy 10.9

Tag: non-standard-game-executable-perm
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The file is owned by the games group but is not mode 2755.  If a
 game does not have to be setgid games, it should be owned by the root
 group like any other executable.  This executable is either owned by the
 wrong group or is not setgid when it should be.
Ref: policy 11.11

Tag: non-standard-setuid-executable-perm
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The file is setuid or setgid and has a mode different from any of
 2755, 4755, 4754, or 6755.  Any other permissions on setuid executables
 is probably a bug.  In particular, removing root write privileges serves
 no purpose, group-writable setuid or setgid executables are probably bad
 ideas, and setgid executables that are not world-executable serve little
 purpose.
Ref: policy 10.9

Tag: setuid-binary

 parse them.
Ref: #588831, #576527

Tag: special-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a <i>special</i> file (e.g., a device file).
 This is forbidden by current policy. If your program needs this device,
 you should create it by calling <tt>makedev</tt> from the postinst
 script.
Ref: policy 10.6

Tag: compressed-symlink-with-wrong-ext
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package installs a symbolic link pointing to a compressed file,
 but the symbolic link does not use the same file extension than the
 referenced file. In most cases, this can produce troubles when the
 user or a program tries to access the file through the link.
Ref: policy 10.5

Tag: symlink-has-double-slash
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: This symlink contains two successive slashes (//). This is in violation
 of policy, where it is stated that symlinks should be as short as possible
 .
 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.
Ref: policy 10.5

 of policy, where it is stated that symlinks should be as short as possible
 .
 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.
Ref: policy 10.5

Tag: symlink-should-be-relative
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Symlinks to files which are in the same top-level directory should be
 relative according to policy.  (In other words, a link in /usr to another
 file in /usr should be relative, while a link in /usr to a file in /etc
 should be absolute.)
 .
 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.

Tag: executable-in-usr-share-doc
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Usually, documentation files in <tt>/usr/share/doc</tt> should have mode
 0644.  If the executable is an example, it should go in
 <tt>/usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/examples</tt>.

Tag: script-in-usr-share-doc
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: Scripts are usually not documentation files, unless they are
 examples, in which case they should be in the
 <tt>/usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/examples</tt> directory.

Tag: symlink-has-too-many-up-segments
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.5
Info: The symlink references a directory beyond the root directory "/".

Tag: lengthy-symlink
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This link goes up, and then back down into the same subdirectory.
 Making it shorter will improve its chances of finding the right file
 if the user's system has lots of symlinked directories.
 .
 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.
Ref: policy 10.5

Tag: symlink-is-self-recursive
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The symbolic link is recursive to a higher directory of the symlink
 itself. This means, that you can infinitely chdir with this symlink. This is
 usually not okay, but sometimes wanted behaviour.

Tag: symlink-contains-spurious-segments
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The symbolic link has needless segments like ".." and "." in the
 middle.  These are unneeded and make the link longer than it could be,
 which is in violation of policy.  They can also cause problems in the
 presence of symlinked directories.
 .
 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.

Tag: run-parts-cron-filename-contains-illegal-chars
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The script in /etc/cron.&lt;time-interval&gt; will not be executed by
 run-parts(8) because the filename contains a "." (full stop) or "+" (plus).
 .
 It is recommended to use "_" (underscores) instead of these symbols.
Ref: run-parts(8), policy 9.5.1

Tag: bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Files in <tt>/etc/cron.d</tt> are configuration files for cron and not
 scripts. Thus, they should not be marked executable.

Tag: bad-permissions-for-etc-emacs-script
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Files in the <tt>/etc/emacs*</tt> directories should not be marked
 executable.

Tag: image-file-in-usr-lib
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: This package installs a pixmap or a bitmap within <tt>/usr/lib</tt>.
 According to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, architecture-independent
 files should be placed within <tt>/usr/share</tt> instead.

Tag: dir-or-file-in-var-www
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Ref: fhs thevarhierarchy
Info: Debian packages should not install files under <tt>/var/www</tt>.
 This is not one of the <tt>/var</tt> directories in the File Hierarchy
 Standard and is under the control of the local administrator.  Packages
 should not assume that it is the document root for a web server; it is
 very common for users to change the default document root and packages
 should not assume that users will keep any particular setting.
 .
 Packages that want to make files available via an installed web server
 should instead put instructions for the local administrator in a
 README.Debian file and ideally include configuration fragments for common
 web servers such as Apache.
 .
 As an exception, packages are permitted to create the <tt>/var/www</tt>
 directory due to its past history as the default document root, but
 should at most copy over a default file in postinst for a new install.
 In this case, please add a Lintian override.

Tag: dir-or-file-in-tmp
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages must not install files into <tt>/tmp</tt> or
 <tt>/var/tmp</tt>.  The File Hierarchy Standard specifies that such files
 may be removed by the administrator and that programs may not depend on
 any files in <tt>/tmp</tt> being preserved across invocations, which
 combined mean that it makes no sense to ship files in these directories.
Ref: fhs tmptemporaryfiles, fhs vartmptemporaryfilespreservedbetwee

Tag: dir-or-file-in-mnt
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages should not install into <tt>/mnt</tt>.  The FHS states that
 this directory is reserved for the local system administrator for
 temporary mounts and that it must not be used by installation programs.
Ref: fhs mntmountpointforatemporarilymount

Tag: dir-or-file-in-opt

Ref: fhs optaddonapplicationsoftwarepackages

Tag: dir-or-file-in-srv
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Debian packages should not install into <tt>/srv</tt>.  The
 specification of <tt>/srv</tt> states that its structure is at the
 discretion of the local administrator and no package should rely on any
 particular structure.  Debian packages that install files directly into
 <tt>/srv</tt> can't adjust for local policy about its structure and in
 essence force a particular structure.
 .
 If a package wishes to put its data in <tt>/srv</tt>, it must do this in
 a way that allows the local administrator to specify and preserve their
 chosen directory structure (such as through post-install configuration,
 setup scripts, debconf prompting, etc.).

 had them open.  It may have been included in the package by accident
 while building the package in an NFS filesystem.

Tag: windows-thumbnail-database-in-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: There is a file in the package named <tt>Thumbs.db</tt> or
 <tt>Thumbs.db.gz</tt>, which is normally a Windows image thumbnail
 database.  Such databases are generally useless in Debian packages and
 were usually accidentally included by copying complete directories from
 the source tarball.

Tag: macos-ds-store-file-in-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: There is a file in the package named <tt>.DS_Store</tt> or
 <tt>.DS_Store.gz</tt>, the file name used by Mac OS X to store folder
 attributes.  Such files are generally useless in Debian packages and were
 usually accidentally included by copying complete directories from the
 source tarball.

Tag: macos-resource-fork-file-in-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: There is a file in the package with a name starting with
 <tt>._</tt>, the file name pattern used by Mac OS X to store resource
 forks in non-native file systems.  Such files are generally useless in
 Debian packages and were usually accidentally included by copying
 complete directories from the source tarball.

Tag: package-installs-perllocal-pod
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package installs a file <tt>perllocal.pod</tt>.  Since that
 file is intended for local documentation, it is not likely that it is
 a good place for documentation supplied by a Debian package.  In fact,
 installing this package will wipe out whatever local documentation
 existed there.

Tag: extra-license-file
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Ref: policy 12.5
Info: All license information should be collected in the

Tag: package-installs-packlist
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages built using the perl MakeMaker package will have a file
 named .packlist in them.  Those files are useless, and (in some cases)
 have the additional problem of creating an architecture-specific
 directory name in an architecture-independent package.
 .
 They can be suppressed by adding the following to <tt>debian/rules</tt>:

Tag: zero-byte-file-in-doc-directory
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The documentation directory for this package contains an empty
 file.  This is often due to installing an upstream NEWS or README file
 without realizing it's empty and hence not useful.

Tag: old-style-config-script
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: The following file is an old style config file,
 used to retrieve information about installed libraries in the system.
 It is typically used to compile and link against one or more libraries.
 .
 Using this kind of system to pass compile file is obsolete and
 will likely introduce bugs in a multi-arch system. Particularly,
 this kind of script could only belong to a package that is not
 Multi-Arch.
 .
 You should consider to move to pkg-config file and
 warn your user to not use this script, and open a bug upstream.
 .
 You should also consider to implement this file as a compatibility
 wrapper over pkg-config.
 .
 After fixing every reverse depends of your package and use
 pkg-config reverse depends makefile, you should
 consider to put this script, as a temporary convenience of your users,
 under /usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/$PACKAGE/bin where
 $DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH is the multi-arch triplet and $PACKAGE is the
 package name. You should also consider to add a NEWS.Debian entry.

Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a hardlink in <tt>/etc</tt> or across different
 directories. This might not work at all if directories are on different
 filesystems (which can happen anytime as the system administrator sees fit),
 certain filesystems such as AFS don't even support cross-directory hardlinks

Info: Package contains a .thumbnails directory. It was most likely installed by
 accident, since thumbnails usually don't belong in packages.
Ref: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html

Tag: package-contains-vcs-control-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a VCS control file such as .(cvs|git|hg)ignore.
 Files such as these are used by revision control systems to, for example,
 specify untracked files it should ignore or inventory files.  This file
 is generally useless in an installed package and was probably installed
 by accident.

Tag: svn-commit-file-in-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains an svn-commit(.NNN).tmp file.  This file is
 almost certainly a left-over from a failed Subversion commit, and does
 not belong in a Debian package.

Tag: svk-commit-file-in-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains an svk-commitNNN.tmp file.  This file is almost
 certainly a left-over from a failed Subversion commit, and does not
 belong in a Debian package.

Tag: nested-examples-directory
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Package contains a <tt>usr/share/doc/something/examples/examples</tt>

Tag: file-in-usr-lib-site-python
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: python-policy 2.5
Info: The directory /usr/lib/site-python has been deprecated as a
 location for installing Python modules and may be dropped from Python's
 module search path in a future version.  Most likely this module is a
 private module and should be packaged in a directory outside of Python's
 default search path.

Tag: python-module-in-wrong-location
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: python-policy 2.5, #576012
Info: The package installs a Python module or debug information for a Python
 module in the wrong location for the given version of Python.
 .
 dh_python3 can be used to fix this for Python 3 modules.

Tag: python-debug-in-wrong-location
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: #576014
Info: The package appears to be installing debug modules in
 /usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/pyshared/pythonX.Y/.  However, gdb(1)
 will not look for it there, making it less useful.  The file
 should be installed in /usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/pymodules/pythonX.Y/
 instead.

Tag: package-installs-python-bytecode

Info: Python eggs should not be installed, since the Debian package is
 supposed to do the required steps for installing the Python code.
 .
 The egg may contain pre-compiled Python bytecode or shared libraries.

Tag: package-contains-python-dot-directory
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a file that looks like cruft from the Python
 build process such as "pytest" cached output or similar.
 .
 As such files are unlikely to be of utility to end-users they should
 not be shipped in the final binary package. They could also conflict
 with files from other packages and/or affect the reproducibility of
 your package.
 .
 Please rebuild using a newer version of pybuild/dh-python which will
 automatically remove many of these files.

Tag: package-contains-python-coverage-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a file that looks like output from the Python
 coverage.py tool.  These are generated by python{,3}-coverage during a test
 run, noting which parts of the code have been executed.  They can then be
 subsequently analyzed to identify code that could have been executed but was
 not.
 .
 As they are unlikely to be of utility to end-users, these files should not
 be shipped in the final binary package.

Tag: package-installs-python-pycache-dir

Certainty: certain
Ref: python-policy 3.7
Info: The package installs a __pycache__ directory, which is normally
 only used to store compiled Python source files. Compiled Python
 source files must not be included in the package, instead they
 should be generated at installation time in the postinst.
 .
 Note this tag is issues even if the directory is empty.

Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 8.4
Info: Ada Library Information (*.ali) files are required to be read-only
 (mode 0444) by GNAT.
 .
 If at least one user can write the *.ali file, GNAT considers whether
 or not to recompile the corresponding source file.  Such recompilation
 would fail because normal users don't have write permission on the
 files.  Moreover, such recompilation would defeat the purpose of
 library packages, which provide *.a and *.so libraries to link against).

Tag: package-contains-readme-for-other-platform-or-distro
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: package contains a README.(platform) file that contains instructions
 specific to a platform or distribution other than Debian and thus can
 most likely be removed.  If it contains information that pertains to
 Debian, please consider renaming it, or including it in an already
 existing README file.

Tag: desktop-file-in-wrong-dir
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a .desktop file in an obsolete directory.
 According to the menu-spec draft on freedesktop.org, those .desktop files
 that are intended to create a menu should be placed in

Tag: script-with-language-extension
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: When scripts are installed into a directory in the system PATH, the
 script name should not include an extension such as <tt>.sh</tt> or
 <tt>.pl</tt> that denotes the scripting language currently used to
 implement it.  The implementation language may change; if it does,
 leaving the name the same would be confusing and changing it would be

 should now go into <tt>/usr/share/sgml</tt>.

Tag: file-name-ends-in-whitespace
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package installs a file or directory whose name ends in
 whitespace.  This might be intentional but it's normally a mistake.  If
 it is intentional, add a Lintian override.
 .
 One possible cause is using debhelper 5.0.57 or earlier to install a
 doc-base file with a Document field that ends in whitespace.

Tag: package-contains-empty-directory
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: This package installs an empty directory.  This might be intentional
 but it's normally a mistake.  If it is intentional, add a Lintian override.

Info: This package contains a *.devhelp or *.devhelp2 file which is not in
 the devhelp search path (<tt>/usr/share/devhelp/books</tt> and
 <tt>/usr/share/gtk-doc/html</tt>) and is apparently not in a directory
 linked into the devhelp search path.  This will prevent devhelp from
 finding the documentation.
 .
 If the devhelp documentation is installed in a path outside the devhelp
 search path (such as <tt>/usr/share/doc</tt>), create a symlink in
 <tt>/usr/share/gtk-doc/html</tt> pointing to the documentation directory.

Tag: duplicate-font-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package appears to include a font file that is already provided
 by another package in Debian.  Ideally it should instead depend on the
 relevant font package.  If the application in this package loads the font
 file by name, you may need to include a symlink pointing to the file name
 of the font in its Debian package.
 .
 Sometimes the font package containing the font is huge and you only need
 one font.  In that case, you have a few options: modify the package (in
 conjunction with upstream) to use libfontconfig to find the font that you
 prefer but fall back on whatever installed font is available, ask that
 the font package be split apart into packages of a more reasonable size,
 or add an override and be aware of the duplication when new versions of
 the font are released.

Tag: icon-size-and-directory-name-mismatch

Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Ref: policy 10.2
Info: This package installs a file in <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf.d</tt>,
 presumably to modify the search path of the run-time linker, and does not
 appear to be part of libc.
 .
 Packages containing shared libraries should either install them into
 <tt>/usr/lib</tt> or should require binaries built against them to set
 RPATH to find the library at run-time.  Installing libraries in a
 different directory and modifying the run-time linker path is equivalent
 to installing them into <tt>/usr/lib</tt> except now conflicting library
 packages may cause random segfaults and difficult-to-debug problems
 instead of conflicts in the package manager.

Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains files under <tt>/usr/share/games</tt>, such as
 desktop files, icons, pixmaps, or MIME type entries, that are global
 system data.  The user's desktop environment will only check in the
 directories directly under <tt>/usr/share</tt> and this information
 should be put in the global directory even if it is for games.
 .
 The most common cause of this problem is using a
 <tt>--datadir=/usr/share/games</tt> argument to configure or an
 equivalent and using the upstream installation rules.  These files need
 to be moved into the corresponding directories directly under
 <tt>/usr/share</tt>.

Tag: duplicated-compressed-file
Severity: minor
Certainty: possible
Info: The given, apparently compressed, file is shipped in the package
 in addition to another file with the same name without the
 compression-method extension.  Normally this indicates a mistake in the
 installation process of the package.

Tag: udev-rule-in-etc
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: #559208
Info: This package ships a udev rule and installs it under
 <tt>/etc/udev/rules.d</tt>, which is reserved for user-installed files.
 The correct directory for system rules is <tt>/lib/udev/rules.d</tt>.

Tag: obsolete-comments-style-in-php-ini
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package ships a <tt>.ini</tt> file used to configure php but
 it has comments using the old-style comment separator <tt>#</tt>.
 Instead, the <tt>;</tt> separator should be used.
 .
 Since version 5.3, the PHP interpreter warns about the use of the
 old style of comment separator.

Tag: triplet-dir-and-architecture-mismatch
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Ref: policy 9.1.1
Info: This package contains a directory under <tt>/lib</tt> or
 <tt>/usr/lib</tt> which doesn't match the proper triplet for the
 binary package's architecture.  This is very likely to be a mistake
 when indicating the underlying build system where the files should be
 installed.

Tag: empty-binary-package
Severity: important
Certainty: wild-guess
Info: This binary package appears to be empty, and its description does
 not say that it's a metapackage or a transitional package.  This is
 often due to problems with updating debhelper *.install files during
 package renames or similar problems where installation rules don't put
 files in the correct place.
 .
 If the package is deliberately empty, please mention in the package long
 description one of the phrases "metapackage", "dummy", "dependency
 package", or "empty package".
 .
 Previously, Lintian also accepted the use of "virtual package".  This
 was removed to avoid overloading the term.  If you have been relying on
 the phrase "virtual package" to avoid this warning, please replace it
 with one of the others.

Tag: empty-udeb-package
Severity: minor
Certainty: wild-guess
Experimental: yes
Info: This udeb package appears to be empty, and its description does
 not say that it's a metapackage or a package.  This is often due to
 problems with updating debhelper *.install files during package
 renames or similar problems where installation rules don't put files
 in the correct place.
 .
 If the package is deliberately empty, you can avoid this tag by
 using one of the following phrases "metapackage", "dummy", "dependency
 package", or "empty package" in the long description of the udeb.

Tag: star-file
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The given file is literally installed as <tt>*</tt> (star
 symbol).  Normally this indicates a mistake in the installation
 process of the package either when creating symlinks or renaming files.

Tag: hyphen-file
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The given file is literally installed as <tt>-</tt> (hyphen
 symbol).  Normally this indicates a mistake in the package when
 attempting to write to standard output.
Ref: #882638

Tag: incorrect-locale-code
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package appears to ship locales for a language but uses an
 incorrect locale code as a subdirectory of <tt>/usr/share/locale</tt>.
 This usually results in users of the intended target language not
 finding the locale.  The language codes used in the locale directories
 are those from the ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 standards, not those
 usually used as TLDs (which are from the ISO 3166 standard).
 .
 When both standards define a language code for a given language, the
 ISO 639-1 code should be used (i.e. the two lettered code).
 .
 Lintian only knows about some commonly-mistaken set of incorrect
 locale codes.

Tag: unknown-locale-code
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
Info: The package appears to ship locales for a language but uses an
 unknown locale code as a subdirectory of <tt>/usr/share/locale</tt>.
 This usually results in users of the intended target language not
 finding the locale.  The language codes used in the locale directories
 are those from the ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 standards, not those
 usually used as TLDs (which are from the ISO 3166 standard).
 .
 It is possible that the language code was mistyped or incorrectly
 guessed from the language's or country's name.

Tag: file-should-not-be-compressed
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The following file should not be compressed.
 .
 This file should be excluded from compression during build time.
 If using debhelper (&lt;&lt; 9.20140227), you may need to use the -X
 option to dh_compress. Newer versions of debhelper handle this
 correctly by default.

Tag: useless-autogenerated-doxygen-file
Severity: minor
Certainty: possible
Info: The package appears to ship files
 from doxygen generated documentation used only
 for internal purpose of doxygen.
 .
 These files are only needed to speed up the
 regeneration of the output when this is done
 in an incremental fashion (i.e. without first deleting
 all output files), and are not needed for
 reading the documentation.

Tag: package-contains-no-arch-dependent-files
Severity: minor
Certainty: possible
Experimental: yes
Info: The package is not marked architecture all, but all the files it
 ships are installed in /usr/share.
 .
 Most likely this package should be marked architecture all, but there
 is a chance that the package is missing files.
Ref: policy 5.6.8

Tag: vim-addon-within-vim-runtime-path
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Vim addons should not be installed directly under a directory contained
 in the Vim runtime path.  Users shall be given the freedom to choose which
 addons they want to have enabled and which they don't.
Ref: vim-policy 3.1

Tag: perl-module-uses-perl4-libs-without-dep
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package includes perl modules using obsoleted perl 4-era
 libraries.  These libraries have been deprecated in perl in 5.14, and
 are likely to be removed from the core in perl 5.16.  Please either
 remove references to these libraries, or add a dependency on
 <tt>libperl4-corelibs-perl | perl (&lt;&lt; 5.12.3-7)</tt> to this package.

Tag: gzip-file-is-not-multi-arch-same-safe
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The gzip file contains a timestamp that will differ between
 architectures.  Multi-Arch: same implies all shared files must be
 byte-for-byte identical.
 .
 This can usually be fixed by passing -n to gzip.

Tag: pkg-config-multi-arch-wrong-dir
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The arch all pkg-config file contains a reference to a multi-arch path.
 .
 This can be usually be fixed by moving this file to a multi-arch path.
 .
 Another likely cause is using debhelper 9 or newer (thus enabling
 multi-arch paths by default) on a package without multi-arch support.
 The usual cure in this case is to update it for multi-arch.
 .
 Last but not least, this file could contain a reference to a cross
 architecture (like for instance an x86_64-linux-gnu pkg-config file
 referencing an i386-linux-gnu file). In this case the usual cure is to
 fix this path.

Tag: pkg-config-bad-directive
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The pkg-config file contains a wrong directive.
 .
 The following file includes a wrong directive. This could lead to
 FTBFS or leak private compile flags to another package.

Tag: dir-or-file-in-home
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Debian packages should not install into <tt>/home</tt>, because it
 is reserved for users.

Tag: dir-or-file-in-build-tree
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The package installs a file in common build paths.
 .
 This often occurs if the package uses regular expressions to
 strip the build path without properly regex quoting the build
 path.

Tag: file-name-is-not-valid-UTF-8
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.10
Info: The file name does not appear to be valid UTF-8.
 .
 Note that Lintian may be unable to display the filename accurately.
 Unprintable characters may have been replaced.

Tag: file-name-in-PATH-is-not-ASCII
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.10
Info: The given file is in PATH but consists of non-ASCII characters.
 .
 Note that Lintian may be unable to display the filename accurately.
 Unprintable characters may have been replaced.

Tag: file-name-contains-wildcard-character
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The file name contains shell wildcard characters.
 .
 These are most likely unexpanded wildcard characters from (for example)
 <tt>debian/*.install</tt> files, or it may have been installed by accident.

Tag: incorrect-naming-of-pkcs11-module
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package ships a PKCS#11 module configuration file under
 <tt>/usr/share/p11-kit/modules</tt>, but its naming doesn't conform
 to what <tt>p11-kit</tt> expects.  Files in that directory should
 respect the following convention, case insensitive:
  [a-z0-9][a-z0-9_.-]*.module
 .
 p11-kit currently warns on every file that does not follow the
 convention and may ignore them in the future.

Tag: package-contains-timestamped-gzip
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a gzip-compressed file that has timestamps.
 Such files make the packages unreproducible, because their
 contents depend on the time when the package was built.
 .
 Please consider passing the "-n" flag to gzip to avoid this.
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds

Tag: missing-intermediate-directory
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains files in the listed directory, but does
 not contain the actual directory itself.  Some tools do not cope
 very well with this case. Notably Lintian prior to 2.5.32 would
 crash on such packages.

Tag: multiarch-foreign-shared-library
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The package is architecture-dependent, ships a shared library in
 a public library search path and is marked <tt>Multi-Arch:
 foreign</tt>. Typically, shared libraries are marked <tt>Multi-Arch:
 same</tt> when possible. Sometimes, private shared libraries are put
 into the public library search path to accommodate programs in the
 same package, but this package does not contain any programs.
 .
 Please remove the <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt> stanza.

Tag: package-installs-deprecated-upstart-configuration
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package installs files into the <tt>/etc/init</tt>
 directory which is used by Upstart, a replacement for the <tt>/sbin/init</tt>
 daemon which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, etc.
 .
 However, Upstart was removed in Debian "stretch" and these files are thus no
 longer useful and should be removed.

Tag: override-file-in-wrong-package
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package includes Lintian overrides intended for another package.
 Lintian overrides should be put in a regular file named
 /usr/share/lintian/overrides/<tt>package</tt>
Ref: lintian 2.4

Tag: package-installs-java-bytecode
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: java-policy 2
Info: Compiled Java source files must not be included in the package.
 This is likely due to a packaging mistake.  These files should be
 removed from the installed package or included in <tt>.jar</tt>
 archives to save space.

Tag: python-module-has-overly-generic-name
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package installs a Python module with an overly generic name to
 a global namespace.
 .
 This was either a mistake and/or likely to cause conflicts with other
 packages.

Tag: multiarch-foreign-cmake-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is architecture-dependent, ships a cmake file in a public,
 architecture-dependent cmake search path and is marked <tt>Multi-Arch:
 foreign</tt>. CMake will be unable to find this file, unless it is installed
 for a matching architecture, but the <tt>foreign</tt> marking says that the
 architecture should not matter.
 .
 Please remove the <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt> stanza.

Tag: multiarch-foreign-pkgconfig
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is architecture-dependent, ships a pkg-config file in a
 public, architecture-dependent pkg-config search path and is marked
 <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt>. pkg-config will be unable to find this file,
 unless it is installed for a matching architecture, but the <tt>foreign</tt>
 marking says that the architecture should not matter.
 .
 Please remove the <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt> stanza.

Tag: multiarch-foreign-static-library
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The package is architecture-dependent, ships a static library in a
 public, architecture-dependent library search path and is marked
 <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt>. A compiler will be unable to find this file,
 unless it is installed for a matching architecture, but the <tt>foreign</tt>
 marking says that the architecture should not matter.
 .
 Please remove the <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt> stanza.

Tag: package-contains-compiled-glib-schema
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a file named <tt>gschemas.compiled</tt>. This
 file is generated automatically by triggers and it must not be shipped in
 any package.
Refs: #883801

Tag: package-contains-compiled-font-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to contain a compiled font file. These files
 should be generated automatically by triggers and it must not be shipped
 in any package.

Tag: pkg-config-unavailable-for-cross-compilation
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The specified pkg-config(1) file is installed to
 <tt>/usr/lib/pkgconfig</tt>. As the cross-compilation wrapper of pkg-config
 does not search this directory the file is unavailable under
 cross-compilation.
 .
 Please install the file to <tt>/usr/lib/${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}/pkgconfig</tt>
 instead.
 .
 For projects that use GNU Autotools, a simple method is moving to a debhelper
 compat level of 9 or higher. In the rare case that this file is architecture
 independent it can be installed to <tt>/usr/share/pkgconfig</tt> instead.

Tag: package-contains-python-doctree-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to contain a pickled cache of reStructuredText
 (*.rst) documentation in a <tt>.doctree</tt> file.
 .
 These are not needed to display the documentation correctly and as they can
 contain absolute build paths can affect the reproducibility of the package.
 .
 Either prevent the installation of the <tt>.doctree</tt> file (or parent
 <tt>doctrees</tt> directory if there is one) or pass the <tt>-d</tt>
 option to <tt>sphinx-build(1)</tt> to create the caches elsewhere.
 .
 For example:
 .
   override_dh_auto_build:
           dh_auto_build
           PYTHONPATH=. sphinx-build -bman docs/ -d debian/doctrees docs/build/html
           PYTHONPATH=. sphinx-build -bhtml docs/ -d debian/doctrees docs/build/html
 .
   override_dh_auto_clean:
           dh_auto_clean
           rm -rf debian/doctrees
Ref: http://sphinx-doc.org/invocation.html#cmdoption-sphinx-build-d

Tag: package-contains-python-hypothesis-example
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to contain the output of running a Python
 "Hypothesis" testsuite.
 .
 These are not useful in the binary package or to end-users. In addition,
 as they contain random/non-determinstic contents, they can affect the
 reproducibility of the package.
 .
 You can disable generation of these files by, for example:
 .
   export HYPOTHESIS_DATABASE_FILE = $(CURDIR)/debian/hypothesis
 .
   override_dh_auto_clean:
           dh_auto_clean
           rm -rf $(CURDIR)/debian/hypothesis

Tag: package-contains-python-tests-in-global-namespace
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to contain Python test files such as
 <tt>test_foo.py</tt> in the global module namespace.
 .
 Whilst the tests may be useful in the binary package, it is probably a
 mistake to pollute the "top-level" namespace in this way.
 .
 Please install them to a subdirectory instead.

Tag: package-contains-file-in-etc-skel
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This package ships the specified file under <tt>/etc/skel</tt>. Files
 in this directory are copied into new user accounts by <tt>adduser(8)</tt>.
 .
 However, <tt>/etc/skel</tt> should be empty as possible as there is no
 mechanism for ensuring files are copied into the accounts of existing
 users when the package is installed.
 .
 Please remove the installation of this file, ensuring this package
 can automatically create them or can otherwise function without them.
Ref: policy 10.7.5

Tag: package-contains-eslint-config-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package ships an ESLint config file. This file is
 a configuration file for the ESLint pluggable linting utility
 for JavaScript.
 .
 Even if these files are useful for modifying the source,
 they do not belong in installed packages.
 .
 Please remove this file from your package.

Tag: package-contains-npm-ignore-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package ships an .npmignore file. This file is a
 configuration file for the npm command, the Node.js package manager.
 .
 This file instructs npm command to keep files out of
 node package and is therefore unnecessary in a Debian package.
 .
 Please remove this file from your package.

Tag: package-contains-documentation-outside-usr-share-doc
Severity: minor
Certainty: wild-guess
Info: This package ships a documentation file outside /usr/share/doc
 Documentation files are normally installed inside <tt>/usr/share/doc</tt>.
 .
 If this file doesn't describe the contents or purpose of the directory
 it is in, please consider moving this file to <tt>/usr/share/doc/</tt>
 or maybe even removing it. If this file does describe the contents
 or purpose of the directory it is in, please add a lintian override.

Tag: header-has-overly-generic-name
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package installs a header to the <tt>/usr/include</tt> global
 namespace with an overly generic name.
 .
 This was either a mistake and/or likely to cause conflicts with other
 packages.

Tag: missing-depends-on-sensible-utils
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The listed file appears to use one or more of the binaries
 in <tt>sensible-utils</tt> but no binary declares a dependency for
 this package.
 .
 As part of the transition to split <tt>sensible-utils</tt> and
 <tt>debianutils</tt>, the remaining <tt>Depends</tt> from
 <tt>debianutils</tt> was removed in version 4.8.2.
 .
 In most cases you will need to add a <tt>Depends</tt>,
 <tt>Recommends</tt>, <tt>Pre-Depends</tt> or <tt>Suggests</tt>
 on <tt>sensible-utils</tt>.

Tag: unknown-file-in-python-module-directory
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package installs the specifiied "non-Python" file in the
 top-level of a Python library directory.
 .
 This was either a mistake and/or will likely to cause conflicts with other
 packages.

Tag: package-contains-file-in-usr-share-hal
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package installs the specified file under
 <tt>/usr/share/hal/</tt> but this directory is no longer looked at
 by any package in Debian since the removal of the <tt>hal</tt> package
 in 2014.
 .
 Please remove or otherwise prevent the installation of this file.

Tag: uses-dpkg-database-directly
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The listed file or maintainer script appears to access the
 internal database(s) of dpkg.
 .
 The entire dpkg database, its layout and files are an internal
 interface and no program or package should be accessing it, other
 than dpkg itself and the suite of dpkg tools.
 .
 Whilst the files may be editable by an admin, that's a supported (but
 unrecommended) feature reserved for humans and not for automatic tools.
