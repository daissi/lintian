Check-Script: version-substvars
Author: Adeodato Sim√≥ <dato@net.com.org.es>
Abbrev: v-s
Type: source
Needs-Info: unpacked
Info: This script checks for correct use of the various
 <tt>*Version</tt> substvars, e.g. deprecated substvars,
 or usage that can cause un-binNMUability

Tag: not-binnmuable-any-depends-any
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:any package
 depends on another arch:any package with a (= ${source:Version})
 relationship. Please use (= ${binary:Version}) instead.

Tag: not-binnmuable-any-depends-all
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:any package
 depends on an arch:all package with a (= ${binary:Version})
 relationship. Please use (= ${source:Version}) instead.
 .
 Note this is also triggered if the dependency uses (&gt;= ${var}),
 since that has the same issue.

Tag: not-binnmuable-all-depends-any
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:all package
 depends on an arch:any package with a strict (= ${source:Version}), or
 similar, relationship.
 .
 It is not possible for arch:all packages to depend so strictly on
 arch:any packages while having the package binNMUable, so please use
 one of these, whichever is more appropriate:
 .
   Depends: arch_any (&gt;= ${source:Version})
   Depends: arch_any (&gt;= ${source:Version}),
    arch_any (&lt;&lt; ${source:Version}.1~)

Tag: version-substvar-for-external-package
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The first package has a relation on the second package using a
 dpkg-control substitution variable to generate the versioned part of
 the relation. However the second package is not built from this
 source package. Usually this means there is a mistake in the package
 name in this dependency.
 .
 Note that this warning can occur if the package name used in the
 relation contains a typo. In this case, correcting the typo should
 remove the warning.

Tag: substvar-source-version-is-deprecated
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package uses the now deprecated ${Source-Version} substvar,
 which has misleading semantics. Please switch to ${binary:Version} or
 ${source:Version} as appropriate (introduced in dpkg 1.13.19, released
 with etch). Support for ${Source-Version} may be removed from dpkg-dev
 in the future.

Tag: maybe-not-arch-all-binnmuable
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: wild-guess
Experimental: yes
Info: Tag to attempt to measure the number of packages that might
 have an issue with arch:all binNMUs.
 .
 At this time, please do <i>not</i> attempt to "fix" the problem. It
 is not clear what the solution is (if any at all),  nor is it clear
 that this is something that will or should be supported.
