Tag: script-without-interpreter
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This file starts with the #! sequence that identifies scripts, but
 it does not name an interpreter.

Tag: example-script-without-interpreter
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This example file starts with the #! sequence that identifies
 scripts, but it does not name an interpreter.

Tag: executable-not-elf-or-script
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This executable file is not an ELF format binary, and does not start
 with the #! sequence that marks interpreted scripts. It might be a sh
 script that fails to name /bin/sh as its shell, or it may be incorrectly
 marked as executable. Sometimes upstream files developed on Windows are
 marked unnecessarily as executable on other systems.
 .
 If you are using debhelper to build your package, running dh_fixperms will
 often correct this problem for you.

Tag: script-not-executable
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This file starts with the #! sequence that marks interpreted scripts,
 but it is not executable.

Tag: interpreter-not-absolute
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script uses a relative path to locate its interpreter.
 This path will be taken relative to the caller's current directory, not
 the script's, so it is not likely to be what was intended.

Tag: example-interpreter-not-absolute
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This example script uses a relative path to locate its interpreter.
 This path will be taken relative to the caller's current directory, not
 the script's, so a user will probably not be able to run the example
 without modification. This tag can also be caused by script headers like
 <tt>#!@BASH@</tt>, which usually mean that the examples were copied out
 of the source tree before proper Autoconf path substitution.

Tag: unusual-interpreter
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package contains a script for an interpreter that is not shipped
 in the package and is not known to Lintian. It is possible that there is
 a typo or the interpreter is not executable. If not, please file a
 wishlist bug against Lintian, so it can be added to the list of known
 interpreters.

Tag: example-unusual-interpreter
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: This package contains an example script for an interpreter that
 is not shipped in the package and is not known to Lintian. It is
 possible that there is a typo or the interpreter is not executable.
 If not, please file a wishlist bug against Lintian, so it can be
 added to the list of known interpreters.

Tag: php-script-with-unusual-interpreter
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package contains a php script using an unusual interpreter in the
 shebang line. The recommended shebang line is either <tt>#!/usr/bin/php</tt>
 or <tt>#!/usr/bin/env php</tt> without any version number.

Tag: script-uses-bin-env
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script uses /bin/env as its interpreter (used to find the
 actual interpreter on the user's path). There is no /bin/env on Debian
 systems; env is instead installed as /usr/bin/env. Usually, the path to
 env in the script should be changed.

Tag: example-script-uses-bin-env
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This example script uses /bin/env as its interpreter (used to find
 the actual interpreter on the user's path). There is no /bin/env on
 Debian systems; env is instead installed as /usr/bin/env. Usually, the
 path to env in the script should be changed.

Tag: forbidden-config-interpreter
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a <tt>config</tt> script for pre-configuring
 the package. During pre-configuration, however, only essential packages
 are guaranteed to be installed, so you cannot use a non-essential
 interpreter.

Tag: forbidden-postrm-interpreter
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a <tt>postrm</tt> maintainer script that uses
 an interpreter that isn't essential. The <tt>purge</tt> action of
 <tt>postrm</tt> can only rely on essential packages, which means the
 interpreter used by <tt>postrm</tt> must be one of the essential ones
 (<tt>sh</tt>, <tt>bash</tt>, or <tt>perl</tt>).
Ref: policy 7.2

Tag: unusual-control-interpreter
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a control script for an interpreter that is
 not normally used for control scripts. This is permissible but not
 recommended. It makes it harder for other developers to understand your
 package.

Tag: unknown-control-interpreter
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: This package contains a maintainer script that uses an interpreter
 that the Lintian maintainers have not heard of. This is usually a typo
 for a common interpreter. If not, please file a wishlist bug on Lintian
 so that the Lintian maintainers can add this interpreter to their list.

Tag: interpreter-in-usr-local
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a script that looks for an interpreter in a
 directory in /usr/local. Since Debian does not install anything in
 /usr/local, this is the wrong place to look.

Tag: example-interpreter-in-usr-local
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains an example script that looks for an
 interpreter in a directory in /usr/local. Since Debian does not install
 anything in /usr/local, the example script would probably need
 modifications before a user could run it.

Tag: control-interpreter-in-usr-local
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: A control script for this package references an interpreter in a
 directory in <tt>/usr/local</tt>. Control scripts must use interpreters
 provided by Debian packages, and Debian packages do not install anything
 in <tt>/usr/local</tt>.

Tag: preinst-interpreter-without-predepends
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a <tt>preinst</tt> maintainer script that uses
 an unusual and non-essential interpreter but does not declare a
 pre-dependency on the package that provides this interpreter.
 .
 <tt>preinst</tt> scripts should be written using only essential
 interpreters to avoid additional dependency complexity. Please do not
 add a pre-dependency without following the policy for doing so (Policy
 section 3.5).
Ref: policy 7.2

Tag: control-interpreter-without-depends
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The package contains a maintainer script that uses an unusual and
 non-essential interpreter but does not declare a dependency on the
 package that provides this interpreter.
Ref: policy 7.2

Tag: missing-dep-for-interpreter
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: You used an interpreter for a script that is not in an essential
 package. In most cases, you will need to add a Dependency on the
 package that contains the interpreter. If the dependency is already
 present, please file a bug against Lintian with the details of your
 package so that its database can be updated.
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: csh-considered-harmful
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The Debian policy for scripts explicitly warns against using csh
 and tcsh as scripting languages.
Ref: policy 10.4

Tag: wrong-path-for-interpreter
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The interpreter you used is installed at another location on Debian
 systems.
 .
 Note that, as a particular exception, Debian Policy ยง 10.4 states that
 Perl scripts should use <tt>/usr/bin/perl</tt> directly and not
 <tt>/usr/bin/env</tt>, etc.
Ref: policy 10.4

Tag: example-wrong-path-for-interpreter
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: The interpreter used by this example script is installed at another
 location on Debian systems. Normally the path should be updated to match
 the Debian location.

Tag: gawk-script-but-no-gawk-dep
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages that use gawk scripts must depend on the gawk package.
 If they don't need gawk-specific features, and can just as easily work
 with mawk, then they should be awk scripts instead.
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: mawk-script-but-no-mawk-dep
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages that use mawk scripts must depend on the mawk package.
 If they don't need mawk-specific features, and can just as easily work
 with gawk, then they should be awk scripts instead.
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: php-script-but-no-php-cli-dep
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages with PHP scripts must depend on the php-cli package.
 Note that a dependency on a php-cgi package (such as php-cgi or php7.0-cgi)
 is needlessly strict and forces the user to install a package that isn't
 needed.
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: python-script-but-no-python-dep
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages with Python scripts should depend on the package
 <tt>python</tt>. Those with scripts that specify a specific version of
 Python must depend, recommend or suggest on that version of Python
 (exactly).
 .
 For example, if a script in the package uses <tt>#!/usr/bin/python</tt>,
 the package needs a dependency on <tt>python</tt>. If a script uses
 <tt>#!/usr/bin/python2.6</tt>, the package needs a dependency on
 <tt>python2.6</tt>. A dependency on <tt>python (>= 2.6)</tt> is not
 correct, since later versions of Python may not provide the
 <tt>/usr/bin/python2.6</tt> binary.
 .
 If you are using debhelper, adding <tt>${python3:Depends}</tt> or
 <tt>${python:Depends}</tt> to the Depends field and ensuring dh_python2 or
 dh_python3 are run during the build should take care of adding the correct
 dependency.
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: ruby-script-but-no-ruby-dep
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages with Ruby scripts must depend on a valid Ruby interpreter.
 Those that have Ruby scripts that run under a specific version of Ruby need a
 dependency on the equivalent version of Ruby.
 .
 If a script in the package uses <tt>#!/usr/bin/ruby</tt>, the package needs a
 dependency on "ruby | ruby-interpreter". This allows users to choose which
 interpreter to use by default. If the package is intended to be used with a
 specific Ruby version, its scripts should use that version directly, such
 as <tt>#!/usr/bin/ruby1.8</tt>
 .
 If a script uses <tt>#!/usr/bin/ruby1.9</tt>, then the package needs a
 dependency on "ruby1.9".
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: wish-script-but-no-wish-dep
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages that include wish scripts must depend on the virtual
 package wish or, if they require a specific version of wish or tk, that
 version of tk.
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: tclsh-script-but-no-tclsh-dep
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Packages that include tclsh scripts must depend on the virtual
 package tclsh or, if they require a specific version of tcl, that
 version of tcl.
 .
 In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends, will
 be more appropriate.

Tag: shell-script-fails-syntax-check
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: Running this shell script with the shell's -n option set fails,
 which means that the script has syntax errors. The most common cause of
 this problem is a script expecting <tt>/bin/sh</tt> to be bash checked on
 a system using dash as <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
 .
 Run e.g. <tt>sh -n yourscript</tt> to see the errors yourself.
 .
 Note this can have false-positives, for an example with bash scripts
 using "extglob".

Tag: example-shell-script-fails-syntax-check

Tag: maintainer-shell-script-fails-syntax-check
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: Running this shell script with the shell's -n option set fails,
 which means that the script has syntax errors. This will likely make
 the package uninstallable.
 .
 Run e.g. <tt>sh -n yourscript</tt> to see the errors yourself.

Tag: possibly-insecure-handling-of-tmp-files-in-maintainer-script
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The maintainer script seems to access a file in <tt>/tmp</tt> or
 some other temporary directory. Since creating temporary files in a
 world-writable directory is very dangerous, this is likely to be a
 security bug. Use the <tt>tempfile</tt> or <tt>mktemp</tt> utilities to
 create temporary files in these directories.
Ref: policy 10.4

Tag: killall-is-dangerous
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The maintainer script seems to call <tt>killall</tt>. Since this
 utility kills processes by name, it may well end up killing unrelated
 processes. Most uses of <tt>killall</tt> should use <tt>invoke-rc.d</tt>
 instead.

Tag: mknod-in-maintainer-script
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.6
Info: Maintainer scripts must not create device files directly. They
 should call <tt>MAKEDEV</tt> instead.
 .
 If <tt>mknod</tt> is being used to create a FIFO (named pipe), use
 <tt>mkfifo</tt> instead to avoid triggering this tag.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-start-stop-daemon
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script seems to call <tt>start-stop-daemon</tt>
 directly. Long-running daemons should be started and stopped via init
 scripts using <tt>invoke-rc.d</tt> rather than directly in maintainer
 scripts.
Ref: policy 9.3.3.2

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-dpkg-maintscript-helper
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script seems to make manual calls to the
 <tt>dpkg-maintscript-helper(1)</tt> utility.
 .
 Please use <tt>package.maintscript</tt> files instead; the
 <tt>dh_installdeb(1)</tt> tool will do some basic validation of some of
 the commands listed in this file to catch common mistakes.
Ref: dpkg-maintscript-helper(1), dh_installdeb(1)

Tag: trailing-slash-for-dpkg-maintscript-helper-symlink_to_dir
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script seems to call dpkg-maintscript-helper
 symlink_to_dir with a trailing slash for pathname. This renders the
 package uninstallable.
Ref: dpkg-maintscript-helper(1)

Tag: missing-call-to-dpkg-maintscript-helper
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script is missing a call to the specified
 dpkg-maintscript-helper command which requires coordinated actions from
 several maintainer scripts.
Ref: dpkg-maintscript-helper(1)

Tag: maintainer-script-removes-device-files
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.6
Info: Maintainer scripts must not remove device files. This is left to
 the system administrator.

Tag: read-in-maintainer-script
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Ref: policy 3.9.1 
Info: This maintainer script appears to use read to get information from
 the user. Prompting in maintainer scripts must be done by communicating
 through a program such as debconf which conforms to the Debian
 Configuration management specification, version 2 or higher.
 .
 This check can have false positives if read is used in a block with a
 redirection, in a function run in a pipe, or in other ways where
 standard input is provided in inobvious ways. If this is the case, please
 add an override for this tag.

Tag: possible-bashism-in-maintainer-script
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: policy 10.4
Info: This script is marked as running under <tt>/bin/sh</tt>, but it seems
 to use a feature found in bash but not in the SUSv3 or POSIX shell
 specification.
 .
 Examples:
  '==' in a test, it should use '=' instead
  'read' without a variable in the argument
  'function' to define a function
  'source' instead of '.'
  '. command args', passing arguments to commands via 'source' is not supported
  '{foo,bar}' instead of 'foo bar'
  '[[ test ]]' instead of '[ test ]' (requires a Korn shell)
  'type' instead of 'which' or 'command -v'

Tag: maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-update-inetd
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls update-inetd, but the package does not depend or
 pre-depend on inet-superserver, any of the providers of inet-superserver
 which provide it, or update-inetd.
 .
 update-inetd has been moved from netbase into a separate package, so a
 dependency on netbase should be updated to depend on "openbsd-inetd |
 inet-superserver".

Tag: maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-adduser
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls adduser, but the package does not depend or
 pre-depend on the adduser package.

Tag: maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-gconf2
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls gconf-schemas, which comes from the gconf2 package,
 but does not depend or pre-depend on gconf2. If you are using dh_gconf,
 add a dependency on ${misc:Depends} and dh_gconf will take care of this
 for you.

Tag: maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-ucf
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls ucf, but the package does not depend or pre-depend
 on the ucf package.

Tag: maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-xml-core
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls update-xmlcatalog, which comes from the xml-core
 package, but does not depend or pre-depend on xml-core. Packages that call
 update-xmlcatalog need to depend on xml-core. If you are using
 dh_installxmlcatalogs, add a dependency on ${misc:Depends} and
 dh_installxmlcatalogs will take care of this for you.

Tag: maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-xfonts-utils
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls a utility provided by the xfonts-utils package
 but does not depend or pre-depend on this package.
 .
 Packages that call update-fonts-scale, update-fonts-dir (etc.) need to
 depend on xfonts-utils.If you are using debhelper.
 .
 Please add a dependency on ${misc:Depends} and dh_installxfonts will
 take care of this for you.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-update-alternatives-remove
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: <tt>update-alternatives --remove &lt;alternative&gt; foo</tt> is
 called in the postrm. This can be dangerous because at the time the
 postrm is executed foo has already been deleted and update-alternatives
 will ignore it while constructing its list of available alternatives.
 Then, if the /etc/alternatives symlink points at foo, update-alternatives
 won't recognize it and will mark the symlink as something site-specific.
 As such, the symlink will no longer be updated automatically and will be
 left dangling until <tt>update-alternatives --auto
 &lt;alternative&gt;</tt> is run by hand.
 .
 <tt>update-alternatives --remove</tt> should be called in the prerm
 instead.
Ref: policy 6*, update-alternatives(8)

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-update-alternatives-set
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script calls <tt>update-alternatives --set
 &lt;alternative&gt; foo</tt> or <tt>update-alternatives --config
 &lt;alternative&gt;</tt> or <tt>update-alternatives --set-selections</tt>.
 .
 This makes it impossible to distinguish between an alternative that's
 manually set because the user set it and one that's manually set because
 the package set it.
Ref: update-alternatives(8)

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-deprecated-chown-usage
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: <tt>chown user.group</tt> is called in one of the maintainer
 scripts. The correct syntax is <tt>chown user:group</tt>. Using "." as a
 separator is still supported by the GNU tools, but it will fail as soon
 as a system uses the "." in user or group names.
Ref: chown(1)

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-hide-init-failure
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls invoke-rc.d to run an init script but then, if the
 init script fails, exits successfully (using || exit 0). If the init
 script fails, the maintainer script should probably fail.
 .
 The most likely cause of this problem is that the package was built with
 a debhelper version suffering from Bug#337664 that inserted incorrect
 invoke-rc.d code in the generated maintainer script. The package needs to
 be reuploaded (could be bin-NMUd, no source changes needed).

Tag: maintainer-script-calls-init-script-directly
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This script apparently runs an init script directly rather than
 using invoke-rc.d. The use of invoke-rc.d to invoke the /etc/init.d/*
 initscripts instead of calling them directly is required. Maintainer
 scripts may call the init script directly only if invoke-rc.d is not
 available.
Ref: policy 9.3.3.2

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-gconftool
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This script apparently runs gconftool or gconftool-2. It should
 probably be calling gconf-schemas or update-gconf-defaults instead.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-fc-cache
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This script apparently runs fc-cache. Updating of the fontconfig
 cache files is now handled automatically by triggers, so running fc-cache
 from maintainer scripts is no longer necessary.

Tag: install-info-used-in-maintainer-script
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: This script apparently runs <tt>install-info</tt>. Updating the
 <tt>/usr/share/info/dir</tt> file is now handled automatically by
 triggers, so running <tt>install-info</tt> from maintainer scripts is no
 longer necessary.
 .
 If debhelper generated the maintainer script fragment, rebuilding the
 package with debhelper 7.2.17 or later will fix this problem.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-modify-netbase-managed-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script modifies at least one of the files
 <tt>/etc/services</tt>, <tt>/etc/protocols</tt>, and <tt>/etc/rpc</tt>,
 which are managed by the netbase package. Instead of doing this, please
 file a wishlist bug against netbase to have an appropriate entry added.
Ref: policy 11.2

Tag: maintainer-script-modifies-inetd-conf
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script modifies <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt> directly.
 This file must not be modified directly; instead, use the
 <tt>update-inetd</tt> script or the <tt>DebianNet.pm</tt> Perl module.
Ref: policy 11.2

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-modify-ld-so-conf
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: This package appears to modify <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt> and does not
 appear to be part of libc. Packages installing shared libraries in
 non-standard locations were previously permitted to modify
 /etc/ld.so.conf to add the non-standard path, but this permission was
 removed in Policy 3.8.3.
 .
 Packages containing shared libraries should either install them into
 <tt>/usr/lib</tt> or should require binaries built against them to set
 RPATH to find the library at run-time. Installing libraries in a
 different directory and modifying the run-time linker path is equivalent
 to installing them into <tt>/usr/lib</tt> except now conflicting library
 packages may cause random segfaults and difficult-to-debug problems
 instead of conflicts in the package manager.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-install-sgmlcatalog
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script apparently runs install-sgmlcatalog.
 install-sgmlcatalog is deprecated and should only have been used
 in postinst or prerm to remove the entries from earlier packages.
 Given how long ago this transition was, consider removing it
 entirely.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-service
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Experimental: yes
Info: The maintainer script apparently runs the service command. This
 command is reserved for local administrators and must never be used
 by a Debian package.
 .
 Please replace with calls to <tt>update-rc.d(8)</tt> and
 <tt>invoke-rc.d(8)</tt>. If your package installs this service, this
 can be automated using <tt>dh_installinit(1)</tt> or
 <tt>dh_installsystemd(1)</tt>.
Ref: policy 9.3.3

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-adduser-system-without-home
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info:  The maintainer script apparently runs 'adduser --system'
 but hardcodes a path under '/home' for the '--home' option or
 does not use the '--home' option.
 .
 The FHS says: /home is a fairly standard concept, but it
 is clearly a site-specific filesystem. The setup will differ
 from host to host. Therefore, no program should rely on this
 location.
 .
 Note that passing --no-create-home alone does not solve the issue
 because home field of passwd file point to a non existing
 /home subdirectory. Please use
 <tt>adduser --no-create-home --home /nonexistent</tt> instead.
Ref: fhs homeuserhomedirectories, adduser(8)

Tag: maintainer-script-may-use-dir_to_symlink_helper
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Experimental: yes
Info: The maintainer script apparently change a directory to a symlink
 not using dir_to_symlink command of dpkg-maintscript-helper, that take
 great care to avoid a lot of problems.
 .
 Please use the dpkg-maintscript-helper dir_to_symlink command.
Ref: dpkg-maintscript-helper(1)

Tag: maintainer-script-empty
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script doesn't seem to contain any code other than
 comments and boilerplate (set -e, exit statements, and the case statement
 to parse options). While this is harmless in most cases, it is probably
 not what you wanted, may mean the package will leave unnecessary files
 behind until purged, and may even lead to problems in rare situations
 where dpkg would fail if no maintainer script was present.
 .
 If the package currently doesn't need to do anything in this maintainer
 script, it shouldn't be included in the package.

Tag: maintainer-script-ignores-errors
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.4
Info: The maintainer script doesn't seem to set the <tt>-e</tt> flag which
 ensures that the script's execution is aborted when any executed command
 fails.

Tag: maintainer-script-without-set-e
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.4
Info: The maintainer script passes <tt>-e</tt> to the shell on the
 <tt>#!</tt> line rather than using <tt>set -e</tt> in the body of the
 script. This is fine for normal operation, but if the script is run by
 hand with <tt>sh /path/to/script</tt> (common in debugging), <tt>-e</tt>
 will not be in effect. It's therefore better to use <tt>set -e</tt> in
 the body of the script.

Tag: command-with-path-in-maintainer-script
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The indicated program run in a maintainer script has a prepended
 path. Programs called from maintainer scripts normally should not have a
 path prepended. dpkg ensures that the PATH is set to a reasonable value,
 and prepending a path may prevent the local administrator from using a
 replacement version of a command for some local reason.
 .
 If the path is used to test a program for existence, please use <tt>if
 which $program > /dev/null; then โฆ</tt>.
 .
 If you intend to override this tag, please make sure that you are in
 control of the installation path of the according program and that
 you won't forget to change this maintainer script, too, if you ever
 move that program around.

Info: The maintainer script calls dpkg-divert with <tt>--local</tt> or
 without <tt>--package</tt>. This option is reserved for local
 administrators and must never be used by a Debian package.

Tag: diversion-for-unknown-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script adds a diversion for a file that is not
 provided by this package.

Tag: orphaned-diversion
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: A diversion was added for the file, but not removed. This means
 your package doesn't restore the previous state after removal.

Tag: remove-of-unknown-diversion
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script removes a diversion that it didn't add. If
 you're cleaning up unnecessary diversions from older versions of the
 package, remove them in <tt>preinst</tt> or <tt>postinst</tt> instead of
 waiting for <tt>postrm</tt> to do it.

Tag: script-uses-perl4-libs-without-dep
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package includes perl scripts using obsoleted perl 4-era
 libraries. These libraries have been deprecated in perl in 5.14, and
 are likely to be removed from the core in perl 5.16. Please either
 remove references to these libraries, or add a dependency on
 <tt>libperl4-corelibs-perl | perl (&lt;&lt; 5.12.3-7)</tt> to this package.

Tag: maintainer-script-has-unexpanded-debhelper-token
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Lintian has detected the presence of a #DEBHELPER# token in the
 listed maintainer/control script. By default, dh_installdeb will remove
 the token when it makes a substitution in a script.
 .
 Please note that dh_installdeb does <i>not</i> substitute the #DEBHELPER#
 token in udebs.

Tag: debhelper-autoscript-in-maintainer-scripts
Severity: classification
Certainty: possible
Info: The maintainer scripts of the package contain one or more
 auto-generated shell snippets inserted by the listed debhelper tool.

Tag: unconditional-use-of-dpkg-statoverride
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The maintainer script appears to use <tt>dpkg-statoverride --add</tt>
 without a prior call to <tt>dpkg-statoverride --list</tt> to check the
 current status.

Tag: script-uses-deprecated-nodejs-location
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: You used <tt>/usr/bin/nodejs</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin/env nodejs</tt> as an
 interpreter for a script.
 .
 The <tt>/usr/bin/node</tt> binary was previously provided by
 <tt>ax25-node</tt> and packages were required to use <tt>/usr/bin/nodejs</tt>
 instead. <tt>ax25-node</tt> has since been removed from the archive and the
 <tt>nodejs</tt> package now ships the <tt>/usr/bin/node</tt> binary to match
 the rest of the Node.js ecosystem.
 .
 Please update your package to use the <tt>node</tt> variant.

Tag: example-script-uses-deprecated-nodejs-location
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: You used <tt>/usr/bin/nodejs</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin/env nodejs</tt> as an
 interpreter for an example script.
 .
 The <tt>/usr/bin/node</tt> binary was previously provided by
 <tt>ax25-node</tt> and packages were required to use <tt>/usr/bin/nodejs</tt>

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-recursive-chown-or-chmod
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The maintainer script appears to call <tt>chmod</tt> or
 <tt>chown</tt> with a <tt>--recursive</tt>/<tt>-R</tt> argument, or
 uses <tt>find(1)</tt> in a similar manner.
 .
 This is vulnerable to hardlink attacks on mainline, non-Debian kernels
 that do not have <tt>fs.protected_hardlinks=1</tt>,
 .
 This arises through altering permissions or ownership within a directory
 that may be owned by a non-privileged user - such a user can link to
 files that they do not own such as <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> or files
 within <tt>/var/lib/dpkg/</tt>. The promiscuous <tt>chown</tt> or
 <tt>chmod</tt> would convert the ownership or permissions of these
 files so that they are manipulable by the non-privileged user.
 .
 Ways to avoid this problem include:
 .
  - If your package uses a static uid, please perform the <tt>chown</tt> at
    package build time instead of installation time.
  - Use a non-recursive call instead, ensuring that you do not change
    ownership of files that are in user-controlled directories.
  - Use <tt>runuser(1)</tt> to perform any initialization work as the
    user you were previously <tt>chown</tt>ing to.

Tag: udevadm-called-without-guard
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The specified maintainer script uses <tt>set -e</tt> but seems to
 call <tt>udevadm(8)</tt> without a conditional guard.
 .
 <tt>udevadm</tt> can exist but be non-functional (such as inside a
 chroot) and thus can result in package installation or upgrade failure
 if the call fails.
 .
 Please guard the return code of the call via wrapping it in a suitable
 <tt>if</tt> construct, appending <tt>|| true</tt> or depending on the
 <tt>udev</tt> package.
Ref: #890224, udevadm(8)

Tag: missing-call-to-update-fonts
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The maintainer script ships the specified X11 font but does not
 appear to call update-fonts-scale or update-fonts-dir in its postinst
 script.
 .
 If you are using dh_installxfonts, add a dependency on ${misc:Depends}
 and dh_installxfonts will take care of this for you.

Tag: multi-arch-same-package-calls-pycompile
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This <tt>Multi-Arch: same</tt> package uses <tt>pycompile</tt> or
 <tt>py3compile</tt> in the specified maintainer script.
 .
 <tt>py{,3}compile</tt> are tools used to byte-compile Python source
 files. It is typically run on installation of Debian packages that ship
 Python modules. However, they do not support installing several
 architectures of the same package and this is not Multi-Arch: safe.
 .
 If the contents of the package is not architecture dependent, it should
 usually be made binary-all.
 .
 If the contents of the package is architecture dependent, it should
 usually get a dependency on the Python interpreter for the same
 architecture. This is a dependency in the form of <tt>python3</tt>, not
 an architecture-qualified dependency such as <tt>python3:any</tt> (which
 can be fulfilled by the Python interpreter for any architecture).
 .
 If a dependency on the Python interpreter for the same architecture
 exists (usually generated by <tt>dh-python</tt>), the
 <tt>Multi-Arch: same</tt> has no effect and should be dropped.

Tag: skip-systemd-native-flag-missing-pre-depends
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: invoke-rc.d(8), deb-systemd-invoke(1p)
Info: This package uses the <tt>--skip-systemd-native</tt>
 <tt>invoke-rc.d</tt> flag in the specified maintainer script but does
 not specify a <tt>Pre-Depends</tt> dependency on a recent version of
 <tt>init-system-helpers</tt>.
 .
 This flag is useful for maintainer scripts that want to defer systemd
 actions to <tt>deb-systemd-invoke(1p)</tt>. However, it was only added
 in <tt>init-system-helpers</tt> version 1.58.
 .
 Please add <tt>Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}</tt> to your
 <tt>debian/control</tt> file.

Tag: maintainer-script-has-invalid-update-inetd-options
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: update-inetd(1), #909758, #909506
Info: The specified maintainer script seems to call
 <tt>update-inetd(1)</tt> with an invalid option combination.
 .
 For example, the <tt>--group</tt< parameter is only valid in
 combination with <tt>--add</tt> and <tt>--pattern</tt> is only valid
 without <tt>--add</tt>.
 .
 Whilst these have been ignored in the past they now emit a warning
 which will become an error in the future, resulting in upgrade/removal
 failures.
 .
 Please correct the call to <tt>update-inetd(1)</tt>.

Tag: missing-versioned-depends-on-init-system-helpers
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: update.d(8), #910593
Info: This package uses a command in the specified maintainer script
 but does not specify an appropriate minimum dependency on the
 <tt>init-system-helpers</tt> package. It may have been added to the
 package's <tt>Build-Depends</tt> instead of the corresponding binary
 package.
 .
 For example, the <tt>defaults-disabled</tt> option was added to
 <tt>update-rc.d</tt> in <tt>init-system-helpers</tt> version 1.50.
 .
 Please add a suitable <tt>Depends:</tt> to your <tt>debian/control</tt>
 file.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-parse-etc-passwd-or-group
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: getent(1), nss(5)
Info: The maintainer script appears to manually parse <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>
 or <tt>/etc/group</tt> instead of using the <tt>getent(1)</tt> utility
 to display entries.
 .
 This bypasses the Name Service Switch (NSS), avoiding querying
 centralised or networked user databases such as LDAP, etc.

Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-use-piuparts-variable
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: piuparts(1), https://piuparts.debian.org/doc/README.html
Info: The maintainer script appears to reference one of the
 <tt>PIUPARTS_*</tt> variables such as <tt>PIUPARTS_TEST</tt> or
 <tt>PIUPARTS_PHASE</tt>.
 .
 These variables are intended to be used by custom <tt>piuparts(1)</tt>
 scripts and not by maintainer scripts themselves.
 .
 Please remove the references to this variable.
