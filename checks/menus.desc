Tag: maintainer-script-does-not-check-for-existence-of-updatemenus
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The maintainer script calls the <tt>update-menus</tt> command without
 checking for existence first. (The <tt>menu</tt> package which provides the
 command is not marked as "essential" package.)
 .
 For example, use the following code in your maintainer script:
  if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ] ; then update-menus ; fi

Tag: executable-menu-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Menu files should normally not be marked as executables. You only
 need to do this if your package has to generate menu entries dynamically.

Tag: menu-file-in-usr-lib
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: As of menu, version 2.1.25, /usr/lib/menu as location for menu
 files is deprecated (but still works perfectly). Menu files should
 now be placed in /usr/share/menu instead. Only menu files that are
 actually binary executables still need to go to /usr/lib/menu.

Tag: executable-in-usr-share-docbase
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Files in <tt>/usr/share/doc-base</tt> may not be marked as executables.

Tag: postinst-does-not-call-updatemenus
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: Since the package installs a file in <tt>/etc/menu-methods</tt>,
 <tt>/usr/share/menu</tt>, or <tt>/usr/lib/menu</tt>, the package should
 probably call the <tt>update-menus</tt> command in it's <tt>postinst</tt>
 script.
 .
 For example, use the following code in your maintainer script:
  if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ] ; then update-menus ; fi

Tag: postinst-has-useless-call-to-install-docs
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: Explicitly calling <tt>install-docs</tt> in <tt>postinst</tt> is no
 longer required since doc-base file processing is handled by triggers.
 If the <tt>install-docs</tt> call was added by debhelper, rebuilding the
 package with debhelper 7.2.3 or later will fix this problem.

Tag: doc-base-document-field-ends-in-whitespace
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The Document field in a doc-base file should not end in whitespace.
 doc-base (at least as of 0.8.5) cannot cope with such fields and

 installing such files.

Tag: doc-base-document-field-not-in-first-line
Severity: important

 reasons.

Tag: doc-base-file-unknown-field
Severity: important
Certainty: certain

 phrase, which was copied verbatim from an example control file found in
 section 2.3.1 of the Debian doc-base Manual.

Tag: doc-base-abstract-might-contain-extra-leading-whitespace
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Continuation lines of the Abstract field of doc-base control file

Tag: doc-base-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: doc-base files must be valid UTF-8, an encoding of the Unicode
 character set.
 .
 There are many ways to convert a doc-base file from an obsolete encoding
 like ISO-8859-1. You may, for example, use "iconv" like:
 .
  $ iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 doc-base &gt; doc-base.new
  $ mv doc-base.new doc-base

Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The section indicated in this doc-base control file has a top-level
 section of Apps or Applications. This section is only used in menu, not
 in doc-base. Simply removing the <tt>Applications/</tt> part of the
 section will lead to a valid doc-base section.

 the standard doc-base sections. The doc-base sections are based on the

 <tt>/usr/share/doc/</tt>, which are usually documentation, but it does
 not register anything in doc-base. (Files under an <tt>examples</tt>
 directory are excluded.)
