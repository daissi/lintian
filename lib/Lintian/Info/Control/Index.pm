=head1 NAME

Lintian::Info::Control::Index - access to collected control file data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;
    my $processable = Lintian::Processable::Binary->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Info::Control::Index provides an interface to control file data.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item control ([FILE])

B<This method is deprecated>.  Consider using
L</control_index_resolved_path(PATH)> instead, which returns
L<Lintian::Path> objects.

Returns the path to FILE in the control.tar.gz.  FILE must be either a
L<Lintian::Path> object (>= 2.5.13~) or a string denoting the
requested path.  In the latter case, the path must be relative to the
root of the control.tar.gz member and should be normalized.

It is not permitted for FILE to be C<undef>.  If the "root" dir is
desired either invoke this method without any arguments at all, pass
it the correct L<Lintian::Path> or the empty string.

To get a list of entries in the control.tar.gz or the file meta data
of the entries (as L<path objects|Lintian::Path>), see
L</sorted_control_index> and L</control_index (FILE)>.

The caveats of L<unpacked|Lintian::Info::Package/unpacked ([FILE])>
also apply to this method.  However, as the control.tar.gz is not
known to contain symlinks, a simple file type check is usually enough.

=cut

sub control {
    ## no critic (Subroutines::RequireArgUnpacking)
    # - see L::Collect::unpacked for why
    my $self = shift(@_);
    my $f = $_[0] // '';

    warnings::warnif(
        'deprecated',
        '[deprecated] The control method is deprecated.  '
          . "Consider using \$info->control_index_resolved_path('$f') instead."
          . '  Called' # warnif appends " at <...>"
    );
    return $self->_fetch_extracted_dir('control', 'control', @_);
}

=item control_index (FILE)

Returns a L<path object|Lintian::Path> to FILE in the control.tar.gz.
FILE must be relative to the root of the control.tar.gz and must be
without leading slash (or "./").  If FILE is not in the
control.tar.gz, it returns C<undef>.

To get a list of entries in the control.tar.gz, see
L</sorted_control_index>.  To actually access the underlying file
(e.g. the contents), use L</control ([FILE])>.

Note that the "root directory" (denoted by the empty string) will
always be present, even if the underlying tarball omits it.

        return;
    }

    my $load_info = {
        'field' => 'control_index',
        'index_file' => 'control-index',
        'index_owner_file' => undef,
        'fs_root_sub' => 'control',
        # Control files are not installed relative to the system root.
        # Accordingly, we forbid absolute paths and symlinks..
        'has_anchored_root_dir' => 0,
    };

    return $self->_fetch_index_data($load_info, $file);
}

=item sorted_control_index

Returns a sorted array of file names listed in the control.tar.gz.
The names will not have a leading slash (or "./") and can be passed
to L</control ([FILE])> or L</control_index (FILE)> as is.

The array will not contain the entry for the "root" of the
control.tar.gz.

    $self->control_index('')
      unless exists $self->{'sorted_control_index'};

    return @{ $self->{'sorted_control_index'} };
}

=item control_index_resolved_path(PATH)

Resolve PATH (relative to the root of the package) and return the
L<entry|Lintian::Path> denoting the resolved path.

The resolution is done using
L<resolve_path|Lintian::Path/resolve_path([PATH])>.
