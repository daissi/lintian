Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package provides an ELF binary that lacks the "read-only
 relocation" link flag. This package was likely not built with the
 default Debian compiler flags defined by <tt>dpkg-buildflags</tt>.
 If built using <tt>dpkg-buildflags</tt> directly, be sure to import
 <tt>LDFLAGS</tt>.
