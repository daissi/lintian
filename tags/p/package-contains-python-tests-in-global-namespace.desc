Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to contain Python test files such as
 <tt>test_foo.py</tt> in the global module namespace.
 .
 Whilst the tests may be useful in the binary package, it is probably a
 mistake to pollute the "top-level" namespace in this way.
 .
 Please install them to a subdirectory instead.
