Check-Script: po-debconf
Author: Denis Barbier <barbier@linuxfr.org>
Abbrev: pd
Type: source
Info: This looks for common mistakes in packages using po-debconf(7).
Needs-Info: unpacked

Tag: not-using-po-debconf
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This package seems to be using debconf templates, but it does not
 use po-debconf to make translations possible (<tt>debian/po</tt> doesn't
 exist). Debian Policy requires that all packages using debconf use a
 gettext-based translation system. If this package uses one other than
 po-debconf, please report this as a Lintian bug along with how to detect
 that system.

Tag: untranslatable-debconf-templates
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: This package seems to be using debconf templates, but some
 descriptions are not translatable. You should prepend an underscore
 before every translatable field, as described in po-debconf(7). This
 may mean that translators weren't properly warned about new strings.
 .
 Translators may be notified of changes using podebconf-report-po, for
 example:
 .
  podebconf-report-po --call --withtranslators --deadline="+10 days" \
  --languageteam
 .
 If the field is not intended for users to see, ensure the first line
 of the description contains "for internal use".

Tag: stray-translated-debconf-templates
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package contains a file named *templates.XX or
 *templates.XX_XX. This was the naming convention for the translated
 templates merged using debconf-mergetemplate. Since the package is using
 po-debconf, these files should be replaced by language-specific files in
 the <tt>debian/po</tt> directory and should no longer be needed.

Tag: missing-potfiles-in
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The required file <tt>POTFILES.in</tt> is missing from
 <tt>debian/po</tt>.
Ref: po-debconf(7)

Tag: missing-file-from-potfiles-in
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: A file listed in <tt>debian/po/POTFILES.in</tt> could not be found
 in the source package.
Ref: po-debconf(7)

Tag: missing-templates-pot
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The required file <tt>templates.pot</tt> is missing from
 <tt>debian/po</tt>.

Tag: unknown-encoding-in-po-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Encoding must be declared in PO files. Otherwise, charset
 conversions cannot be performed.

Tag: invalid-po-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Errors were found in the listed PO file that will cause its content
 to be discarded. Run <tt>msgfmt</tt> on the file to see the error
 messages.

Tag: debconf-translation-using-general-list
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This debconf translation is using the general debconf-i18n list as
 the address in the Language-Team field.
 .
 The intended purpose of the Language-Team field is to be an additional
 contact for new translation requests in addition to the previous
 translator (as recorded in Last-Translator). The field should therefore
 point to a mailing list dedicated to the language of this PO file, not
 the general list for translation discussions.

Tag: misnamed-po-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The name of this PO file doesn't appear to be a valid language
 code. Any files in <tt>debian/po</tt> ending in <tt>.po</tt> will be
 processed as translations by po2debconf for the language code equal to
 the file name without the trailing <tt>.po</tt>. If the file name does
 not correctly reflect the language of the translation, the translation
 will not be accessible to users of that language.
 .
 If this file isn't actually a PO file, rename it to something that
 doesn't end in <tt>.po</tt> or move it to another directory so that
 translation merging programs will not be confused.

Tag: newer-debconf-templates
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: debconf-updatepo has not been run since the last change to your
 debconf templates.
 .
 You should run debconf-updatepo whenever debconf templates files are
 changed so that translators can be warned that their files are
 outdated.
 .
 This can be ensured by running debconf-updatepo in the 'clean' target
 of <tt>debian/rules</tt>. PO files will then always be up-to-date when
 building the source package.

Tag: translated-default-field
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: You should not mark as translatable "Default:" or "DefaultChoice:"
 fields, unless explicitly needed (e.g. default country, default language,
 etc.). If this Default field really should be translated, you should
 explain translators how they should translate it by using comments or
 brackets. For example:
 .
   # Translators: Default language name, but not translated
   _Default: English
 .
 Or:
 .
   _Default: English[ Default language name, but not translated]
 .
 Note that in the first case, Lintian ignores the comment unless it
 explicitly references translators and it is appears directly before
 the field in question.

Tag: no-complete-debconf-translation
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: Even though this package provides debconf translation support, there 
 are no translations or none of the translations are complete. This may
 mean that translators weren't properly warned about new strings.
 .
 Translators may be notified of changes using podebconf-report-po, for
 example:
 .
  podebconf-report-po --call --withtranslators --deadline="+10 days" \
  --languageteam
Ref: devref 6.5.2.2

Tag: invalid-potfiles-in
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Errors were found in the <tt>debian/po/POTFILES.in</tt> file.
 .
 Please make sure that all strings marked for translation are in uniform
 encoding (say UTF-8) then prepend the following line to POTFILES.in and
 rerun intltool-update.
 .
  [encoding: UTF-8]
