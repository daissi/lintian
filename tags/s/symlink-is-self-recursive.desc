Tag: symlink-is-self-recursive
Severity: warning
Certainty: possible
Check: files/symbolic-links
Info: The symbolic link is recursive to a higher directory of the symlink
 itself. This means, that you can infinitely chdir with this symlink. This is
 usually not okay, but sometimes wanted behaviour.
