Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This script calls update-xmlcatalog, which comes from the xml-core
 package, but does not depend or pre-depend on xml-core. Packages that call
 update-xmlcatalog need to depend on xml-core. If you are using
 dh_installxmlcatalogs, add a dependency on ${misc:Depends} and
 dh_installxmlcatalogs will take care of this for you.
