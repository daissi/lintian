Tag: duplicate-conffile
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The file is listed more than once in your <tt>debian/conffiles</tt> file.
 Usually, this is because debhelper (dh_installdeb, compat level 3 or higher)
 will add any files in your package located in /etc automatically to the list
 of conffiles, so if you do that manually too, you'll get duplicates.
