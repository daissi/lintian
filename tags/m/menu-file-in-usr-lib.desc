Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Check: menus
Info: As of menu, version 2.1.25, /usr/lib/menu as location for menu
 files is deprecated (but still works perfectly). Menu files should
 now be placed in /usr/share/menu instead. Only menu files that are
 actually binary executables still need to go to /usr/lib/menu.
