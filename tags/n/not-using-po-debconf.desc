Tag: not-using-po-debconf
Severity: error
Check: debian/po-debconf
Info: This package seems to be using debconf templates, but it does not
 use po-debconf to make translations possible (<tt>debian/po</tt> doesn't
 exist). Debian Policy requires that all packages using debconf use a
 gettext-based translation system. If this package uses one other than
 po-debconf, please report this as a Lintian bug along with how to detect
 that system.
