Tag: debian-watch-file-is-missing
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 4.11, uscan(1)
Info: This source package is not Debian-native but it does not have a
 <tt>debian/watch</tt> file. This file is used for automatic detection of
 new upstream versions by the Debian External Health Status project and
 other project infrastructure. If this package is maintained upstream,
 please consider adding a <tt>debian/watch</tt> file to detect new
 releases.
 .
 If the package is not maintained upstream or if upstream uses a
 distribution mechanism that cannot be meaningfully monitored by uscan
 and the Debian External Health Status project, please consider adding a
 <tt>debian/watch</tt> file containing only comments documenting the
 situation.

Tag: debian-watch-file-declares-multiple-versions
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: The <tt>debian/watch</tt> file in this package contains multiple
 lines starting with <tt>version=</tt>. There should be only one version
 declaration in a watch file, on the first non-comment line of the file.

Tag: debian-watch-file-unknown-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: The <tt>version=</tt> line in the <tt>debian/watch</tt> file in this
 package declares an unknown version. The currently known watch file
 versions are 2, 3 and 4

Tag: debian-watch-file-missing-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: The <tt>debian/watch</tt> file in this package doesn't start a
 <tt>version=</tt> line. The first non-comment line of
 <tt>debian/watch</tt> should be a <tt>version=</tt> declaration. This
 may mean that this is an old version one watch file that should be
 updated to the current version.

Tag: debian-watch-file-should-mangle-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1), https://wiki.debian.org/DEHS
Info: The version of this package contains <tt>dfsg</tt>, <tt>ds</tt>,
 or <tt>debian</tt>, which normally indicates that the upstream source
 has been repackaged to comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines
 (or similar reason), but there is no version mangling in the
 <tt>debian/watch</tt> file. Since the <tt>dfsg</tt> string is not
 part of the upstream version, the <tt>debian/watch</tt> file should
 use the dversionmangle option to remove the <tt>dfsg</tt> before
 version number comparison.

Tag: debian-watch-file-should-dversionmangle-not-uversionmangle
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/DEHS
Info: The version of this package contains <tt>dfsg</tt>, <tt>ds</tt>,
 or <tt>debian</tt>, but a misleading upstream version mangling occurs in
 the <tt>debian/watch</tt> file. Since the <tt>dfsg</tt> string is not
 part of the upstream version and its addition is Debian-specific, the
 <tt>debian/watch</tt> file should use the dversionmangle option to
 remove, instead of adding in uversionmangle, the <tt>dfsg</tt> before
 comparing version numbers.

Tag: debian-watch-file-should-uversionmangle-not-dversionmangle
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/DEHS
Info: The version of this package contains <tt>alpha</tt>, <tt>beta</tt>,
 or <tt>rc</tt>, but a misleading Debian version mangling occurs in
 the <tt>debian/watch</tt> file. You should use the uversionmangle
 option instead of dversionmangle so that the prerelease is sorted by
 uscan before a possible future final release.

Tag: debian-watch-file-in-native-package
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/DEHS
Info: The package ships a watch file although it is a Debian native
 package. DEHS does not process watch files in native packages based on
 the reasoning that native packages do not have upstreams to check for new
 releases.

Tag: debian-watch-file-uses-deprecated-sf-redirector-method
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The watch file seems to be passing arguments to the redirector
 other than a path. Calling the SourceForge redirector with parameters like
 <tt>project</tt> prevents uscan from generating working URIs to the files
 and thus has been deprecated and is no longer supported by the redirector.

Tag: debian-watch-file-should-use-sf-redirector
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: The watch file specifies a SourceForge page or download server
 directly. This is not recommended; SourceForge changes their download
 servers and website periodically, requiring watch files to be modified
 every time. Instead, use the qa.debian.org redirector by using the magic
 URL:
 .
   http://sf.net/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;tar-name&gt;-(.+)\.tar\.gz
 .
 replacing <tt>&lt;project&gt;</tt> with the name of the SourceForge
 project and <tt>&lt;tar-name&gt;</tt> with the name of the tarball
 distributed within that project. Adjust the filename regex as necessary.

Tag: debian-watch-file-uses-deprecated-githubredir
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/10/msg00000.html
Info: The watch file specifies a githubredir.debian.net URL, which is deprecated
 Instead, use direct links to the tags page:
 .
  version=3
  https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/tags .*/(.*)\.tar\.gz
 .
 replacing <tt>&lt;user&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;project&gt;</tt> with the Github
 username and project respectively.

Tag: debian-watch-file-specifies-wrong-upstream-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: The watch file specifies an upstream version which exactly matches
 the version of a <tt>debian/changelog</tt> entry, this is not a
 native package, and no version mangling is being done. The version
 field in a watch file should specify the expected upstream version, not
 the version of the Debian package. Any epochs and Debian revisions
 should be removed first or mangled away.

Tag: debian-watch-file-specifies-old-upstream-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The watch file specifies an upstream version number which matches
 the upstream portion of an old <tt>debian/changelog</tt> entry, and the
 current <tt>debian/changelog</tt> entry specifies a newer upstream
 version. The version number in the watch file is very likely to be
 incorrect and probably should be replaced with the current expected
 upstream version. Otherwise, DEHS and similar projects will think the
 package is out of date even when it may not be.

Tag: debian-watch-does-not-check-gpg-signature
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Experimental: yes
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: This watch file does not specify a means to verify the upstream
 tarball using a cryptographic signature.
 .
 If upstream distributions provides such signatures, please use the
 <tt>pgpsigurlmangle</tt> options in this watch file's <tt>opts=</tt> to
 generate the URL of an upstream GPG signature. This signature is
 automatically downloaded and verified against a keyring stored in
 <tt>debian/upstream/signing-key.asc</tt>
 .
 Of course, not all upstreams provide such signatures but you could
 request them as a way of verifying that no third party has modified the
 code after its release (projects such as phpmyadmin, unrealircd, and
 proftpd have suffered from this kind of attack).

Tag: debian-watch-file-pubkey-file-is-missing
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: This watch file verifies a cryptographic signature but
 the upstream public key is missing.
 .
 Please add upstream public keys in either
 debian/upstream/signing-key.asc or
 debian/upstream/signing-key.pgp.

Tag: debian-watch-could-verify-download
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: uscan(1)
Info: One or more upstream signing keys are present in the Debian package
 but are not being used.
 .
 Please enable the cryptographic verification of downloads with the
 "pgpsigurlmangle" option in your watch file or remove the key.

Tag: debian-watch-contains-dh_make-template
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: The watch file contains a standard template included by dh_make.
 Please remove them once you have implemented the watch file.

Tag: debian-watch-uses-insecure-uri
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: The watch file uses an unencrypted transport protocol for the
 URI such as http:// or ftp://. It is recommended to use a secure
 transport such as HTTPS for anonymous read-only access.
 .
 Upstream may already provide a HTTPS variant of the URI. If not,
 please contact them and ask them to consider adding one.
