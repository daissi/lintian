Tag: systemd-service-file-outside-lib
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package ships a systemd service file outside
 <tt>/lib/systemd/system/</tt>
 .
 Systemd in Debian searches for unit files in <tt>/lib/systemd/system/</tt>
 and <tt>/etc/systemd/system</tt>.  Notably, it does <i>not</i> look
 in <tt>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</tt> for service files.
 .
 System administrators should have the possibility to overwrite a
 service file (or parts of it, in newer systemd versions) by placing a
 file in <tt>/etc/systemd/system</tt>, so the canonical location used
 for service files is <tt>/lib/systemd/system/</tt>.

Tag: systemd-tmpfiles.d-outside-usr-lib
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package ships a systemd tmpfiles.d(5) conf file outside
 <tt>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/</tt>

Tag: systemd-service-file-refers-to-obsolete-target
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The systemd service file refers to an obsolete target.
 .
 Some targets are obsolete by now, e.g. syslog.target or dbus.target. For
 example, declaring <tt>After=syslog.target</tt> is unnecessary by now because
 syslog is socket-activated and will therefore be started when needed.

Tag: systemd-service-file-refers-to-obsolete-bindto
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The systemd service file refers to the obsolete BindTo= option.
 .
 The <tt>BindTo=</tt> option has been deprecated in favour of
 <tt>BindsTo=</tt> which should be used instead.

Tag: omitted-systemd-service-for-init.d-script
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The specified init.d script has no systemd equivalent and the
 package ships other units.
 .
 This typically occurs when a maintainer missed script when adding
 systemd integration, or a new init script was added in a new upstream
 version.
 .
 Systemd has a SysV init.d script compatibility mode. It provides access to
 each SysV init.d script as long as there is no native service file with the
 same name (e.g. <tt>/lib/systemd/system/rsyslog.service</tt> corresponds to
 <tt>/etc/init.d/rsyslog</tt>).

Tag: missing-systemd-service-for-init.d-script
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The specified init.d script has no equivalent systemd service.
 .
 Whilst systemd has a SysV init.d script compatibility mode, providing
 native systemd support has many advantages such as being able to specify
 security hardening features.
 .
 Please provide a suitable .service file for this script.

Tag: missing-systemd-service-for-init.d-rcS-script
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/pkg-systemd/rcSMigration
Info: The rcS init.d script has no systemd equivalent.
 .
 Systemd has a SysV init.d script compatibility mode. It provides access to
 each SysV init.d script as long as there is no native service file with the
 same name (e.g. <tt>/lib/systemd/system/rsyslog.service</tt> corresponds to
 <tt>/etc/init.d/rsyslog</tt>).
 .
 Services in rcS.d are particularly problematic, because they often cause
 dependency loops, as they are ordered very early in the boot sequence.

Tag: init.d-script-does-not-source-init-functions
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> script does not source
 <tt>/lib/lsb/init-functions</tt>. The <tt>systemd</tt> package provides
 <tt>/lib/lsb/init-functions.d/40-systemd</tt> to redirect
 <tt>/etc/init.d/$script</tt> calls to systemctl.
 .
 Please add a line like this to your <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> script:
 .
  . /lib/lsb/init-functions

Tag: maintainer-script-calls-systemctl
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/pkg-systemd/Packaging
Info: The maintainer script calls systemctl directly. Actions such as enabling
 a unit file should be done using <tt>deb-systemd-helper</tt> so that they work
 on machines with or without systemd. Starting a service should be done via
 <tt>invoke-rc.d</tt>, if the service has a corresponding sysvinit script, or
 <tt>deb-systemd-invoke</tt> if it does not.
 .
 If you are using debhelper, please use the <tt>systemd</tt> debhelper
 addon, which is provided by <tt>debhelper (&gt;= 9.20160709~) | dh-systemd</tt>.

Tag: init-script-is-not-a-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains an init script that is not a regular file or
 resolvable symlink.

Tag: service-file-is-not-a-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a service file that is not a regular file or
 resolvable symlink.

Tag: service-key-has-whitespace
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The systemd service file contains space in the key definitions
 .
 Service files should not have spaces surrounding the <tt>=</tt> key.
 They are not explicitly supported by systemd, and third party tools
 have been known to break.
 .
 Please remove the spaces surrounding the key definition.

Tag: systemd-service-alias-without-extension
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Alias=
Info: The service file lists an alias without a file extension.
 .
 The spec mandates that the extension of the listed alias matches
 the extension of the unit itself.

Tag: systemd-service-file-missing-documentation-key
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: The systemd service file does not contain a <tt>Documentation</tt> key.
 .
 Documentation for systemd service files can be automatically viewed using
 <tt>systemctl help servicename</tt> if this field is present.
Ref: systemd.unit(5)

Tag: systemd-service-file-missing-install-key
Severity: normal
Certainty: wild-guess
Info: The systemd service file does not contain a <tt>WantedBy=</tt> or
 <tt>RequiredBy=</tt> key in its <tt>[Install]</tt> section.
 .
 Forgetting to add such a line (e.g. <tt>WantedBy=multi-user.target</tt>)
 results in the service file not being started by default.
Ref: systemd.unit(5)

Tag: systemd-service-file-wraps-init-script
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The listed service file simply uses ths existing SysV init script
 via ExecStart, ExecStop, etc.
 .
 The main logic of more complex init scripts should be moved into helper
 scripts which can be used directly from both the .service file and the
 init script. This will also make the init scripts more readable and easier
 to support other alternatives. Note that as /etc/init.d/* files are
 conffiles, such updates are not guaranteed to reach users.

Tag: systemd-service-file-refers-to-unusual-wantedby-target
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The specified systemd service file declares an unusual
 <tt>WantedBy=</tt> relationship.
 .
 Most services that want to be started automatically at boot should use
 <tt>WantedBy=multi-user.target</tt> or <tt>WantedBy=graphical.target</tt>.
 Services that want to be started in rescue or single-user mode should
 instead use <tt>WantedBy=sysinit.target</tt>
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/pkg-systemd/rcSMigration

Tag: systemd-service-file-pidfile-refers-to-var-run
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: The specified systemd service file declares a <tt>PIDFile=</tt>
 that references <tt>/var/run</tt>.
 .
 <tt>/var/run</tt> is now merely a symlink pointing to <tt>/run</tt> and
 thus it is now considered best practice that packages use <tt>/run</tt>
 directly.
 .
 Please update the specified service file.
