Tag: ocaml-dangling-cmxa
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This package provides a <tt>.cmxa</tt> library without its
 implementation (<tt>.a</tt> static library).

Tag: ocaml-dangling-cmx
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: This package provides a <tt>.cmx</tt> module without its
 implementation (<tt>.o</tt> object file which may be embedded in a
 <tt>.a</tt> static library installed in the same directory).

Tag: ocaml-dangling-cmxs
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package seems to be a library package, and provides a native
 plugin (<tt>.cmxs</tt>). If the plugin is meant to be used as a library
 for other plugins, it should be shipped as bytecode (<tt>.cma</tt> or
 <tt>.cmo</tt>) as well.

Tag: ocaml-dev-file-not-in-usr-lib-ocaml
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: This development package installs OCaml development files
 (<tt>.cmi</tt>, <tt>.cmx</tt> or <tt>.cmxa</tt>) outside
 <tt>/usr/lib/ocaml</tt>. Such files are used only by compilation and
 should be in a subdirectory of OCaml standard library path.

Tag: ocaml-stray-cmo
Severity: minor
Certainty: wild-guess
Info: This package installs a <tt>.cma</tt> file and a <tt>.cmo</tt> file
 with the same base name. Most of the time, the module provided by the
 <tt>.cmo</tt> file is also linked in the <tt>.cma</tt> file, so the
 <tt>.cmo</tt> file is useless.

Tag: ocaml-dangling-cmi
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: This package installs a compiled interface (<tt>.cmi</tt>) without
 its text version (<tt>.mli</tt>). The text version should also be
 installed for documentation purpose. If the module involved doesn't have
 a <tt>.mli</tt>, its source code (<tt>.ml</tt>) should be installed
 instead.

Tag: ocaml-dev-file-in-nondev-package
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: possible
Info: This package doesn't appear to be a development package, but
 installs OCaml development files (<tt>.cmi</tt>, <tt>.cmx</tt> or
 <tt>.cmxa</tt>). These files should be moved to a development package.

Tag: ocaml-meta-without-suggesting-findlib
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: This development package installs a META file but doesn't depend on
 ocaml-findlib. Libraries with META file are easier to use with findlib.
 The package should at least suggest ocaml-findlib.
