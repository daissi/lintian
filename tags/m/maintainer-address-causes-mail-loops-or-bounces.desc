Severity: error
Check: fields/maintainer
Info: The maintainer e-mail address either loops back to itself because
 it is set to an address which is known to bounce mails. Policy
 states: The email address given in the Maintainer control field must
 accept mail from those role accounts in Debian used to send automated
 mails regarding the package. This includes non-spam mail from the bug-
 tracking system.
Ref: policy 3.3
