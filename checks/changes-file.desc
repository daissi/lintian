Tag: malformed-changes-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: There is no "Format" field in your .changes file. This probably
 indicates some serious problem with the file. Perhaps it's not actually
 a changes file, or it's not in the proper format, or it's PGP-signed
 twice.
 .
 Since Lintian was unable to parse this .changes file, any further checks
 on it were skipped.

Tag: no-description-in-changes-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: There is no "Description" field in your .changes file. A
 description is mandatory and is usually constructed from the descriptions
 in the control file of the package by the package build tools.

Tag: bad-distribution-in-changes-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: You've specified an unknown target distribution for your upload in
 the <tt>debian/changelog</tt> file. It is possible that you are uploading
 for a different distribution than the one Lintian is checking for. In
 that case, passing --profile $VENDOR may fix this warning.
 .
 Note that the distributions <tt>non-free</tt> and <tt>contrib</tt> are no
 longer valid. You'll have to use distribution <tt>unstable</tt> and
 <tt>Section: non-free/xxx</tt> or <tt>Section: contrib/xxx</tt> instead.

Tag: multiple-distributions-in-changes-file
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: You've specified more than one target distribution for your upload
 in the <tt>*.changes</tt> file, probably via the most recent entry in the
 <tt>debian/changelog</tt> file.
 .
 Although this syntax is valid, it is not accepted by the Debian archive
 management software. This may not be a problem if this upload is
 targeted at an archive other than Debian's.

Tag: no-urgency-in-changes-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: There is no "Urgency" field in the .changes file. This field is

Severity: important
Certainty: certain

 most recent entry in <tt>debian/changelog</tt>, which is probably where
 the error is.

Tag: changed-by-name-missing
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The Changed-By field seems to contain just an email address. It must
 contain the package maintainer's name and email address.
Ref: policy 5.6.4

Tag: changed-by-address-missing
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain

Tag: backports-changes-missing
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: The changes file only has changelog entries from a single version. It
 is recommended for backports to include all changes since (old)stable or
 the previous backport. This can be done by adding the '-v' option to the
 build with the appropriate version.

Tag: backports-upload-has-incorrect-version-number
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The version number doesn't comply with the standard backport version
 rules. It should end in ~bpoX+N, where X is the release version number of
 the target distribution.
Ref: http://backports.debian.org/Contribute/

Tag: upload-has-backports-version-number
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The version number looks like a backport, but the upload's target
 distribution is not a backport suite.

Tag: distribution-and-changes-mismatch
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The <tt>Distribution</tt> in the <tt>.changes</tt> file indicates
 that packages should be installed into one distribution (suite), but the
 distribution in the <tt>Changes</tt> field copied from
 <tt>debian/changelog</tt> indicates that a different distribution
 was intended.

 This is an easy mistake to make when invoking "sbuild ... foo.dsc".
 Double-check the <tt>-d</tt> option if using sbuild in this way.

Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>Distribution</tt> in the <tt>.changes</tt> file indicates
 that packages should be installed into a non-experimental distribution
 (suite), but the distribution in the <tt>Changes</tt> field copied from
 <tt>debian/changelog</tt> indicates that experimental was intended.

 Debian derivative.

 on such fields.

Tag: package-builds-dbg-and-dbgsym-variants
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: dh_strip(1), https://wiki.debian.org/AutomaticDebugPackages
Info: This package appears to build both -dbg and -dbgsym variants of a
 package. Only one package should contain the debug symbols
 .
 Usually the -dbg should be dropped in favour of the -dbgsym. However,
 in some cases (e.g. Python modules) the -dbg contains more than just 
 the debug symbols. In these cases the -dbgsym should not be built.
