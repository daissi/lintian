Severity: warning
Check: debian/rules
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package appears to use
 <tt>-Wl,--as-needed</tt> linker flag.
 .
 The bullseye toolchain defaults to linking with <tt>as-needed</tt> and
 therefore it should no longer be necessary to inject this into the
 build process.
